Trip Report Pinch Creek by Ken Cooper
</p>
<p>
April 19, 1998 Pinch and Glade Creeks Tom Snead, Bill Matlin, Ken Cooper
</p>
<p>
A lot of people I know, myself included, when younger, armed with a new drivers license and the
parentÂs car would spend hours exploring back roads close to home. Sometimes we would get
completely lost and find ourselves in a new corner of the county we never knew existed.
Eventually our network of roads began to connect and then lead us again to a new adventure,
further and further from home. Being able to discover something new, and feeling like youÂre the
first person to ever experience it is one of the things I miss from childhood.
</p>
<p>
Paddlers tend to do this same thing with small creeks. When IÂm exploring a run for the first
time it reminds me of my adolescent days driving aimlessly with inseparable friends, expanding
our boundaries. Sometimes, while paddling, a tributary will catch my eye. I begin to imagine
hiking up a couple of miles to explore what is just out of site. Most of these are just way too
small to ever consider boating. But occasionally you stumble on to one that has possibilities.
You just canÂt stop thinking about what surprises it may contain. You may even purchase topo
maps and begin pouring over them during the coldest winter nights.
</p>
<p>
When I first began paddling Glade Creek several winters ago, just this type of stream caught my
eye. Even though Glade was the most challenging thing I had paddled at that time, a tributary
about half way down caught my eye. I began to think about the 160Â per mile section of creek I
had just paddled through just upstream. I began to think about the multitude of 10Â drops that
still had my heart pumping. I began to think there must be some of the same type whitewater on
that little tributary, of which I could only glimpse about 100Â upstream from the mouth.
</p>
<p>
Glade Creek has become one of my favorite runs and every time I run it, I find myself glancing up
Pinch Creek as I float by. Pinch Creek separates upper and lower glade and enters from river
right at the midpoint of the run. A year and a half ago, I couldnÂt fight the urge to buy the
topo map and at least see on paper where it went. The map indicated a paved road crossed the
creek about 4 miles up from its mouth and that the first several miles dropped at an easy rate.
The final mile, which dropped 200Â according to the map, is what caught my attention and
promised to provide excitement and exploration. I asked around but no one I could find had ever
boated it. I only heard that a group had paddled it in duckies about 10 or 15 years ago but no
one I knew could give me any solid information about it. Last January, I talked my wife Evie into
going on a hike with me. Of course to me hiking means scouting creeks. We headed to the mouth of
Pinch and managed to make it a couple of miles upstream before the banks became too steep to
hike. It was difficult to see everything Pinch Creek had to offer due to the steep banks and
thick Rhododendron. We were able, however, to see a couple of 10Â falls and numerous slides
which only served to further wet my appetite. While I was driving home from a run on Meadow Creek
earlier this winter, I pulled out my topo maps and went in search of the put in. I found it just
as it was getting dark so I couldnÂt look at much but I did talk to a local farmer who told me
he had never seen anyone around there before with kayaks. He began to warn me about the falls on
it. I explained that IÂd seem them on my earlier hike and thatÂs exactly why I was anxious to
paddle it. After describing the two falls IÂd seen, he said I had missed the third and largest
falls. At least twice a tall as the ones IÂd scouted, probably 20Â to 25Â high. Now I was
really psyched!
</p>
<p>
Recently, a weekend of rain began to bring up the level of creeks around Beckley. The trees were
beginning to get small green buds and sprout thirsty leaves, a bad sign to see if you are
obsessed with running creeks. I knew if I would catch Pinch Creek this year, this would be my
last chance. Tom Snead, Bill Matlin and I drove to the mouth of Glade. The level did not look to
be unusually high but running moderately. This did not look real promising for Pinch but we all
agreed to go look at it. If it looked too low, we would just back track and run lower Glade. We
arrived at the headwaters of Pinch Creek but really could not tell much from it. It was only
about 10Â wide and looked like a drainage ditch flowing through a cow pasture. How were we
supposed to tell how it might look downstream from this? We decided to put on and try it, for
better or worse. Bill was the first in his boat and waited just downstream while Tom and I
fidgeted around with gear and finally launched. Bill took off right in front of us and soon the
little stream was covered with thick, overhanging brush. Tom and I fought our way through this
for several hundred yards and when we came out the other side, Bill was nowhere in sight ahead of
us. Since there was no way we could have passed him on a 10Â wide ditch, we knew he had gotten
way ahead of us somehow. We took off, trying to catch up. After we paddled hard for about 1 mile
and carried 2 trees, we started to wonder if we could have passed him. But no way, we thought.
How could you pass somebody on a 10Â wide stream and not see them. We began to drift slowly and
watch behind us as well as in front wondering what could have happened to Bill. We reasoned if he
was in front, heÂd wait at the first falls. If we were in front, weÂd wait at the first falls.
Finally we heard a whistle blowing behind us and soon Bill came into view around a bend. He
explained heÂd taken a smaller channel at the beginning while we were paddling in the underbrush
and ended up stuck inside a refrigerator! He did not hear us pass him and he was also paddling
along not knowing if he was in front of or behind us. We decided not to question him too much
about how you actually get stuck inside a refrigerator!
</p>
<p>
After about 1 Â½ miles of paddling flat, moving water from the put in, the creek left
civilization behind. For another mile or so, Pinch moved through continuous class II shoals
through remote West Virginia scenery full of laurel and pine trees. Small streams kept adding
small amounts of volume and soon it was beginning to look like a real creek. Around every bend,
weÂd check for a horizon line that would indicate the 25Â falls the farmer had told me about.
This was starting to feel like one of those weekend afternoon drives on an unknown country road
from my youth! Soon a horizon line came into view which I recognized as one of the 10Â falls
Evie and I had seen on our scouting trip. I mean hiking trip! This was an easy run on the left
side. Below the first falls Pinch began picking up some speed. There were a couple more easy
slides and soon the second 10Â falls I had found on our hike. Another easy boof in the center
into a 3Â or 4Â deep pool. This was a very wide falls and we could paddle back upstream through
the falls into the ÂroomÂ behind it. Once behind the falls you could paddle from one side of
the creek to the other.
</p>
<p>
Below the second falls, the creek began to drop even more quickly. We encountered several blind
drops that required a couple of scouts. There was nothing exceedingly difficult but we could tell
we were into the 200Â per mile section. Since this was the final mile, and IÂd already seen
this from the bank, I began to relax a little and figured that the farmer had been pulling my leg
about the 25Â falls. This disappointed me a little but I also felt a little relieved. The run
became a series of long slide type rapids that donÂt require a lot of finesse, kind of like
sleigh riding and watching for downed trees. I found myself out in front of Bill and Tom, and as
I came around a bend in the creek I was looking at nothing but horizon line and tree tops. Wow, I
thought this must be the 25 footer he was talking about! My adrenaline pumped as I passed up the
far upstream eddy and headed for one I spotted about 30Â upstream from the horizon line. The
water became shallow and picked up speed above the lip of the falls. I took a couple of strokes
forward to drive into the last chance eddy. I was anxious to get out and look at what challenge
lay ahead. As my bow crossed the eddy line, my heart sank as I realized this eddy was poorly
formed and shallow. I was not about to get stopped in this puny thing! Oh God I thought, as my
boat skidded through the little eddy, not even beginning to slow down. For a second, I tried to
pull my skirt and scramble out, hoping I could gain some footing on the shale bottom. No good,
the Mountain Surf skirt was not going to come off quickly. I turned the boat downstream and
realized I was about 15Â from the lip and at least 20Â above where I was about to land. I
tucked my thighs back under the braces and pressed my feet hard against the bulkhead. I stared
hard at the lip hoping to find some clue about where I was about to be launched. Nothing. As the
nose of my boat moved out into thin air, I got one good boof stroke in, dropped about 6Â landing
hard on a sloping reef and gently slid another 15Â or 20Â down to the bottom of the drop. Whew!
Soon, Bill appeared, scrambling down the bank and peering over the edge to see if there were
survivors. He was relieved to see me laughing and getting ready to take pictures of them running
it. This turned out to be a very straight forward, 25Â high sloping falls. Bill talked Tom into
running it without scouting so he could get the same rush I got running it blind!
</p>
<p>
We ran several more slides before reaching the mouth. At one slide, The water funneled down and
flowed along a cliff on river left. The top of the slide had two trees hanging over it and the
bottom careened off a pillowed rock and veered hard to the right. Tom and I agreed crashing
through the trees at that speed looked painful and we were mature enough to walk it. Bill on the
other hand, apparently had something to prove! Tom and I stood on the bank laughing as he parted
the branches with his face, spun 90 degrees, flipped at the pillow and skidded down the last part
of the drop on his helmet. We called that one right! All in all Pinch Creek delivered on itÂs
promise of adventure. Of the approximately 4 miles we paddled, only about 1 Â½ miles provided any
appreciable whitewater excitement. Even though, most of this creek offers beautiful scenery
comparable to upper Glade Creek. Most of the rapids are slides. Some of these end in 3Â Â 4Â
ledges which keep the water dripping off your eyebrows. The two 10Â falls are shear drops and
very straight forward. Our run was made at fairly low water but another 6Â of water could
provide an exciting, downhill, luge run.
</p>
<p>
We continued down lower Glade to our takeout vehicle at the mouth. After being on Pinch, this
felt like paddling on New River. The water was rising on Glade and provided a quick, lively run
to the bottom. It was nice paddling with Bill and Tom on this run. Bill will be moving to Oregon
in a week for a job change and this will probably be one of our last runs together in WV. Tom had
not been real active paddling during the last year and this was sort of a reunion weekend.
Regardless, while we were leap-frogging our way down Pinch Creek, it seemed like one of those
carefree weekend days of my youth.
