<h2>River Description</h2>
<p>
If there is one river in the southeast that truly has it all, it is the Linville River. Born atop
the highlands of the Blue Ridge near Newland and Linville, North Carolina, the Linville River
floats slowly and quietly for several miles. Just after passing under the Blue Ridge Parkway
though, it breaks through the main crest of the Blue Ridge unlike neighboring rivers like the
Watauga, Elk, and Nolichucky, which follow a much more reasonable path through the gentler
northwestern end of the region. As a result of the river following this difficult path, there is
only a relatively short horizontal distance the river has to drop the abrupt 2000 feet all the
way down to the Piedmont lowlands below.
</p>
<p>
What allows the river to cut through this ridge instead of flowing off the backside like most
streams is a geologic fault plane. This contact between materials that were thrust up and on top
of each other millions of years ago made an excellent spot for the river to begin its work
cutting through the billion year old core of the Blue Ridge. The river quickly was able to down
cut through the weak region in contact with the fault plane and this process produced a giant
gorge that runs right down the middle of Linville Mountain that is in some spots as much as 2300
vertical feet below the surrounding high points along the rim. The high gradient and complex
geology of the gorge create intense and demanding rapids that are sustained for distances
unparalleled in the eastern United States.
</p>
<p>
Due to the rugged terrain produced by this type of structure, much of the gorge was not logged
completely, so there are still old growth areas left. The wilderness area designation also helps
with maintaining the rugged feel of the gorge. The hiking trails alone are serious, with one mile
in Linville equating out to more like 2 anywhere else in the southeast.
</p>
<p>
In turn, the Linville River is hands down the most epic, beautiful, and quality stretch of
whitewater to be found east of the Mississippi. Nowhere else in the region can there be found a
stretch of non stop class 4-5+ rapids for a duration of around 6-7 miles. Most streams of this
caliber can go a maximum of 1-2 miles before flattening out. There is a considerable amount of
bedrock that produces wild and memorable rapids, as well as insanely complex boulder jumbles that
create anywhere from excellent clean drops to more marginal manifestations. The <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/17582/">scenery</a> is unbeatable
anywhere in the SE. The views of Babel Tower, Sitting Bear, <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/17583/">Hawks Bill</a>, <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/16423/">Table Rock</a>, North
Carolina Wall, Shortoff Mountain and many more vistas leave the paddler taken aback. There are
more than a few spots where the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/11890/">canyon walls</a> rise
straight out of the water and rise for hundreds of feet. No banks, no boulders, just overhanging
rock walls. At normal flows the run though continuously filled with rapids, has a pool drop
nature, which provides a relatively controlled environment where decisions can be made one at a
time, with enough space in between to admire the surroundings.
</p>
<p>
The same factors that make this run so incredible also make it a place where mistakes and
misjudgments can prove to have dire consequences. The geology of predominantly granitic gneiss
produces sheet like boulders that are angular and fall on top of each other in ways that produce
many voids and gaps between them. When water flows over these boulders it also flows around,
through, and under them. Also there are many instances where these boulder lie on bedrock, which
creates hazards as well. Due to these circumstances, the character of the streambed is the most
dangerous encountered in whitewater boating. Most rapids have many <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/8417/">undercuts and sieves</a>,
and due to the way the boulders stack, changes occur frequently. Other examples of this type of
streambed are the Lower Rocky Broad, the Lower Meadow, and Black Canyon of the Gunnison. The four
things any paddler considering Linville must have are flawless boat control, water reading
skills, scouting skills, and good judgment. In a nutshell, this is not the place for the
inexperienced boater. Someone who triple crowns the Green everyday but has only been boating for
2 years is not necessarily ready to deal with the unbelievable amount of serious decisions that
must be made on this run. Running things blind is a horrible idea, as often there is only one
safe line or sometimes none at all with little warning. If you are a survival boater, keep
driving over to Wilson Creek or Watauga, because the Linville WILL call your bluff.
</p>
<p>
<b>Putins and Takeouts</b>
</p>
<p>
In the early days of boating Linville, there were few methods of accessing the gorge other than
puting in at the falls and taking out at the Hwy 126 bridge just a half mile above Lake James.
The run was typically done as an overnighter. With improved trail knowledge, advances in
equipment technology, and the growing willingness to hike with your boat, a myriad of putin and
takeout options have become popular. There are several access points and many can be used as
putins AND takeouts depending on the desired stretch one wishes to paddle, and what kind of
shuttle set up one wants. Some of the stretches require two cars, yet some only require a bike
shuttle. Others again can be jogged in as little as 30 minutes. You have to decide what stretch
you want to paddle/deal with, and also factor in your shuttle situation, tolerance for hiking and
or flatwater paddling, and how long of a day you want. Though there are many trails down to the
river that are not used often due to poor trail conditions, there are a series of decent trails
into the gorge that are best broken into East Rim trails and West Rim trails.
</p>
<p>
<b>East Rim Access Trails</b>
</p>
<p>
East Rim Access Trails are found spurring to the west off of the road that goes to Table Rock
from Hwy 183 between Newland and Morganton, NC. A few miles to the south of Jonas Ridge is a turn
to the west onto Gingercake Road. Turn here and then take the left fork a short distance in.
There are two access trails that are used for putins and takeouts found along this road.
</p>
<p>
-Brushy Ridge Trail-
</p>
<p>
This trail is an excellent way to putin for a run through the steep section of the river if one
does not want to mess with the Cathedral Gorge and plans to takeout at the relatively easy Spence
Ridge trail. The shuttle is also only around 5 miles, which makes this an easy bike shuttle or
hitch run during the summer when there are plenty of cars travelling the road. The trail puts the
paddler in a half mile above the first falls in the upper stretch of the river and allows one to
paddle the better part of the paddle in, but still keeps the paddle in reasonable, clocking in at
around 2 miles to reach Babel Tower Rapid. The two miles above Babel are beautiful, go fast, and
are interspersed with fun class 3-4 bedrock rapids. Once again this trail is only worth using if
you plan on hiking out at Spence Ridge. The trail is around 1.7 miles to the river. To reach the
trailhead, go right at the fork in the road at Gingercake and after around a mile, turn left onto
Mtn Park road and go around half a mile to a circle that has little parking area on the right.
There is a little sign in rock with the letters BRT. Park here and take the obvious path into the
woods. The majority of the hike is relatively flat and smooth. About 1.3 miles in the trail
starts knife ridging out Brushy Ridge and begins to drop precipitously. Stay on the ridge and
take a look around for a few good views. There is one spot where the trail disappears, but
continue down and to the right and keep going through the tight and brushy stretch until you drop
into a saddle where a crude campsite is located. From this saddle, drop to your right (North)
down a steep slope 250 feet to the river. This trail will take around 45 minutes to an hour to
hike and is similar in effort to hiking in at Babel Tower, though the going at the end is a
little rougher than anything on Babel Tower.
</p>
<p>
-Spence Ridge Trail-
</p>
<p>
Though Spence Ridge has been used as a putin for those going to the lake, it is more widely used
as a takeout for the upper gorge. The only thing one will miss is the Cathedral Gorge, which is
the crux of the run. Taking out here makes for a lower stress day than going all the way to the
lake or running Babel to Conley. The trailhead is 5 miles down the road towards Table Rock and is
signed and has ample parking. The trail does one long switchback before following a little stream
steeply all the way down to the river above Cathedral Gorge. Going up from the river the hike is
around 1.7 miles long and typically takes anywhere from 40-60 minutes to hike with a boat.
Another big attraction of this hike out is that you avoid the horrendous carry out at Conley
Cove. Conley Cove gains 1100 feet in just over a mile, whereas Spence Ridge only gains 800 feet
over a longer distance, 1.7 miles.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<b>West Rim Access Trails</b>
</p>
<p>
Access located on the West Rim spur to the east off of NC 105 (Kistler Memorial Highway). This
road is reached by either coming in from the North off of 183just south of the intersection with
221 in Linville Falls, or coming in from the South off of Hwy 126 a few miles west of the
crossing of the Linville River at the takeout. This highway is the one used to run shuttle if one
is doing the whole river. Luckily in between the falls and the lake are a few other putin/takeout
options.
</p>
<p>
-Linville Falls Trailhead- [<strong>AW&nbsp;ACCESS&nbsp;ALERT:</strong> The Blue Ridge Parkway
(National Park Service) currently prohibits paddling on the Linville River within Park Service
boundaries, which extend to roughly 1/3 of a mile below Linville Falls. Violating this current
closure can result in a $5,000 fine and up to 6 months in jail.&nbsp; We are leaving the
description of the Linville Falls Trailhead accesson this page as a factual record of a valuable
river access location, but strongly recommend against paddling the short Park Service section of
the Linville River below the falls.]
</p>
<p>
This putin is treacherous and there is no trail, and is therefore not recommended. There are
plenty of other options further down the gorge on both sides. The parking for this putin trail is
located 100 yards down NC 105 from its northern terminus with Hwy 183. This is the putin to be
used if one wishes to paddle the chilled out and sometimes long paddle in for the upper gorge.
From the falls down to Babel Tower Rapid, the river has mostly class 2-3 rapids with a fair
amount of flatwater. There are a few decent class 4 rapids though. Many opt to skip this putin
and go down to Babel Tower, but the river is beautiful and makes a convenient putin if one does
not want to hike on both ends of a trip. This is also a great putin to add extra river mileage if
one is planning on taking out a Spence Ridge. Walk the trail at the south end of the parking lot
half a mile to an intersection with a larger trail. Walk straight through the intersection up and
over a knoll to a spot where there is a steep treacherous route down to the base of the falls.
Doing a little pre-route scouting helps here. Most people use ropes to lower down the 150 feet of
slippery rocky stair steps to the plunge basin. From the car to the pool below the falls is not
far on a map, but this last stretch of boat lowering takes considerable time. Plan on around 30
minutes of work to putin here. Finally, try to avoid this putin as much as possible, as it has a
somewhat environmentally insensitive factor to it, due to the lack of any official trail.
</p>
<p>
-Babel Tower-
</p>
<p>
This 1.3 mile trail is rough in spots, but provides a convenient putin for those wanting to start
right out at the good stuff. It takes around 35-45 minutes to hike in, which consists of parking
at the signed pull off 3 miles down from the 183 intersection and hiking down into the gorge.
Over halfway you will reach a saddle at Babel Tower and can turn right or left onto the Linville
River Trail. Turn left and upstream and go another ten minutes until reaching a little stream.
Take the faint trail down with this stream 100 feet to the rock outcrop above Babel Tower Rapid.
It should be noted that if one is willing to carry out here, a great 4.5 mile class 2-3+(4) run
through the upper gorge paddle in is worth the effort for those less able to access the mostly
class 5 remainder of the gorge. Mainly this is used as the putin for the typical Babel to Conley
trip, or as a putin for Babel to the lake.
</p>
<p>
-Conley Cove-
</p>
<p>
This trail is around 7 or 8 miles down from the 183 intersection and is the toughest of all the
commonly used boat access trails. The trail switchbacks straight up the side of the gorge, 1.2
miles, climbing around 1100 feet. The parking area is signed. If you are taking out here you
probably putin at Babel but also could have put in at the falls. Running to here as opposed to
Spence Ridge adds the Cathedral Gorge to the end of the run. Some paddlers put in here for what
is considered the Lower Linville Gorge, Conley to the Lake. Hiking down is easier than up, and it
is recommended to bring water, a headlamp, endurance, and patience. This hike is considerably
more demanding than the Spence Ridge hike out on the other side of the gorge
</p>
<p>
-Pinch In Trail-
</p>
<p>
Conveniently located half a mile below the last class 4 rapid in the gorge, this would be a
convenient hike out, but the vertical gain is absurd, at around 1800 feet. Combine that with the
1.5 length and poor trail conditions and its easy to see why if people paddle below Conley they
just go to the lake.
</p>
<p>
-Hwy 126 at Lake James-
</p>
<p>
This is the bottom takeout. It is reached by turning North on the graded road just west of the
Hwy 126 crossing of the Linville River. Drive a hundred yards and park at the wide spot on the
right, next to the river. This is also the gauge location.

<b>Rapids and River Descriptions</b>
</p>
<p>
There are a handful of distinct sections to the river. I will break the description into these
sections and describe them each from top to bottom.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note: No one talks about these rapids much, so I have had to name them. If they already have a
name and you feel I should change them, just make a comment or send me some feedback. No need to
get upset!</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>-Linville Falls to the Bends-</b>
</p>
<p>
This is the top stretch and starts at the base of Linville Falls. There is a nice <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/17584/">15 footer</a> above the
falls, but the river is posted off limits here due to the danger immediately below.
</p>
<p>
After putin in at the base of the falls there are a handful of class 3 rapids spread out over the
next 2.5 miles down to the Brushy Ridge Access point. The river is shoaly and wide in spots and
is mostly bedrock bottomed. The river is very similar to section 3 of the Chatooga through here,
with lots of scrapy class 2 and excellent scenery. Well into this stretch there is a nice little
bedrock flume rapid and at the end of the straightaway this rapid is on the river makes a tight
sweeping turn around a point on the right and on the left is a huge 500 foot amphitheater with
stunning rock faces.
</p>
<p>
At this point, the first ledge is encountered. Its a simple boof of around 5-6 feet with a
shallow landing. The river picks up to class 2-3 for a bit and halfway through the next
straightaway is where Brushy Ridge Trail comes in on river left down off the the steep wall and
onto a nice bedrock landing on the left. Below here the river enters &quot;The Bends&quot;.
</p>
<p>
<b>-The Bends to Babel Tower Rapid-</b>
</p>
<p>
This stretch is absolutely beautiful with plenty of fun class 3-3+ rapids and a few class 4-
drops as well. It lasts around 2 miles down to the first serious drop at Babel Tower Rapid.
</p>
<p>
Below Brushy Ridge trail the river drops over some class 2-3 bedrock slides that are fun but
usually scrapy. The walls grow to considerable heights here and be on the look out for trees
growing upside down from the undersides. At the end of this long straightaway is a sharp bend to
the left, and on this bend is the first sizable rapid on the river, first falls. The river drops
close to 20 feet here down a smooth bedrock sliding drop. The only good line is on the right
where the water is. Scouting can be done from the left, but usually is not necessary. Just go
straight down the tongue on the right side of the falls down a 10 foot sloping slide that ramps
you off of around a 6 foot drop. Great fun and harmless for the most part.
</p>
<p>
Below here the river splits at an island with most of the flow going right. Go with it, but at
the end of the constriction the river drops through a jagged boulder field with a few pin spots
and sieves. Bang through far right. There is a boof in the middle that works but its hard to see
from above and has sieves all around it.
</p>
<p>
Next the river goes straight a little further before entering the most fascinating stretch of the
bends. The river turns sharply to the left again and slides down a smooth class 3 slide with a
huge boulder in the center of the river. Go right here. After another pool the river channelizes
to the right and goes down a pretty fun class 3+ slide that drops around 15 feet over the course
of 100 feet. Go with the flow on this one and enjoy.
</p>
<p>
The next bend to the right brings a manky boulder pile and then another bend to the right brings
a fun class 3 that offers a nice eddy out on the left under a big overhanging wall with water
showering down from above. Next on a bend to the left is a fun little technical move that is
found on river right. Stay right here for the good line. Then the river reaches a point where a
low wall comes down to river level on the left and the channel turns sharply right at a sizable
horizon line. This is California Dreamin, named after the gently sloping rock on the left and the
smooth horizon line. This rapid is a 10 foot sloped ledge with a nice fun factor. This stretch is
all bedrock and there are a few more fun slides below. The river stays consistent class 3 all the
way down to Babel Tower Rapid from here. After a bend to the left the walls really close in and
the realization that things are about to get serious hits hard.
</p>
<p>
After a few hundred yards of fun class 3+ rapids is Babel Tower Rapid. Eddy out right to scout
and do not inadvertently stumble into this one. You would probably be okay with a random clueless
run but it would be scary. Babel Tower Trail is reached by climbing up the trail next to the
feeder on the right for 100 feet and then turning left onto the Linville River Trail. This trail
goes 1/3 mile up to the intersection with Babel Tower Trail. This trail turns right and goes over
a mile back up to NC 105.

</p>
<p>
This stretch is the beginning of the serious whitewater of Linville, which goes for a non stop 7
miles that drops around 1300 feet! This is the beginning of the longest stretch of class 5
anywhere around, with the whole West Prong of the Little Pigeon in TN coming in a distant second.
It starts right off with one of the largest drops on the run, Babel Tower. For the next 3/4 mile
the river winds clockwise around the Babel Tower rock formation, which creates a moat of sorts.
It will definitely feel like it when you are in there.
</p>
<p>
At <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/11780/">Babel Tower
Rapid</a>, scout on the right. The river piles into the left wall and turns back right as it
drops down a 12 foot slot with a boof on the right side and a steep tongue on the left. In the
middle these two features intertwine, forming a curling sheet of water that can cause
unpredictable consequences. The bottom has a pocket on the left wall that can dole out some
beatings but usually is not a factor. There are no entrapment hazards and the rapid flushes quite
well. It is rather tricky to run smoothly though. Most people do the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/16377/">harder line</a>, which
involves staying hard against the left wall at the top, so as to create a good drive back right
to hit the boof located on the right side of the slot. Its hard to make it over here if you are
not starting against the left wall. The other line is a low and late graduated <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/11781/">boof on the left wall</a>
heading downstream. This is a good option if the other line is not working out, as this line
requires little paddling as all the water heads left. Regardless of your line, shake it off in
the pool below and get ready for a lot more.
</p>
<p>
Below here are two excellent slides. The first is at the bottom of a class 3 stubble field. Start
left and then drive right down through a narrow 15 foot sliding drop back to the right. The left
side falls under a shelf. Immediately after this you are on the right wall and the river turns
back to the center and goes down a curler packed white out of a slide that drops about the same
as the first. Hit the pool at the bottom and note the wild rock walls encompassing you from every
direction. Its all rock and water in here and nothing else. A small sliding drop requiring left
angle follows and dumps into a pool above the first of several must run rapids.
</p>
<p>
Here at <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/11891/">Nowhere
to Run</a> the river drives down a boulder field with overhanging walls on both sides and no
place to portage at all. There is a way to scout on the left at a small beach of cobbles and
boulders, but it can be hard to see what&rsquo;s going on. The standard line is down the right
side boofing an entry ledge that angles into a channel against the right wall with another drop
onto a rock and then an exit ledge of around 3 feet. However at low water the middle drop can be
a big hit, and during these circumstances a center line can be boat scouted with a left and back
right motion. This burly rapid deposits you into the most gorged out spot to be found on any
river in the SE. The overhanging walls rise hundreds of feet on both sides directly out of the
water, and time seems to stand still here.
</p>
<p>
At the end of this enchanting slot canyon is a ledge that requires a hard drive right and then a
class 3 run out drop follows. The next rapid is Up Against the Wall, a juicy slide against the
right wall packed with holes and curls. The bottom has a large hole and thrashings are common
here. Keep your speed and your bow up, and keep paddling out of the backwash at the bottom. Good
stuff.
</p>
<p>
After the slide the river goes a little further before turning 90 degrees to the right and into
Mankyou Very Much, a shitty boulder pile. Run on the right with a double boof with crunchy
landings. Then ferry left and finish the runout.
</p>
<p>
Next is one of the best boofs on the river, a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/17588/">sweet shoulder boof</a>
of 7 feet off of a big rock on the right bank. Immediately following is one of the worst boofs on
the river, <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/41287/">China</a>, aka Scary
Boof. This is the first of many rapids that are run but not always fun. A boulder in the center
of the river splits the flow to the left and off of an 8 foot drop with a grabby lip. There are
undercuts on both sides and the landing is always a sub out with a feeling of uncertainty to it.
Portage right or run with speed on the left.
</p>
<p>
Below here is a fabulous class 3-4 boogie section. Hit these drops center for the meat or driving
left to stay out of the holes and undercuts. After 100 yards of this the river turns another 90
degrees to the right and South where it starts to enter the next section. The first rapid after
this bend is Pile of Crap, a otherwise fine rapid that has a log wedged parallel to flow in the
crux region. It is hard to get over at medium flows or less and resultantly pushes&nbsp;directly
into a bad undercut in the center/left of the river. Wheelchair through at medium to low flows on
the right or run with conviction down the center and back to the right with good water.
</p>
<p>
<b>-Used to be a Portage to Jailhouse-</b> This stretch lasts only a mile but is probably the
most time consuming of any mile on the trip due to a few portages and a lot of scary and
consequential drops.
</p>
<p>
The action starts with Used to be a Portage. The whole right side of the river is a horrible
undercut nightmare, and there used to be no way around, but a channel on the left has opened up.
Simply drive down the far left side and after dropping in start heading further left. Its bouncy
and low fun but it beats portaging.
</p>
<p>
After a short stretch of fun class 3 boogie comes Wheelie, aka S-Turn. This rapid used to be all
fun and no scare, but the floods of 2004 changed some things and this rapid now has the worst
hole on the whole river. Portaging can be done on the left, and the rapid runs down the right
sloshing back and forth with beautiful wall curlers before charging down off a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/17589/">diagonal ledge</a> into a
fearsome pocket hole on the left side of the channel. It can be punched but has an alarmingly
small success rate. The only safe line is to stay low in the curls and use the last one on the
left wall to throw you right, away from the left side of the ledge and either into a hanging eddy
on the right or off the right side of the ledge. Be careful on the right side as it feeds back
left. This spot is the reason throw ropes were manufactured.
</p>
<p>
The river is now in a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/17564/">bedrock paradise</a> very
reminiscent of California. After charging off some class 3 ledges the river drops out of sight
onto a nice tongue on the right, dropping around 8 feet with speed. There is a pocket eddy on the
left that can be very difficult to exit, but too far right can lead to an abrupt and disorienting
piton with the right wall. Run it center and blast the bottom well lest the pocket wants to chat
with you.
</p>
<p>
Below the next pool is a great class 4 zig zag through bedrock features with holes and fun curls
to punch through.
</p>
<p>
After the next big pool is Skylight, a small but consequential rapid run down the far right side
of the river boofing downstream. The left side is a bad undercut and after running right there is
an undercut bank on the right that is also of concern. The rapid is named for a neat pothole at
the bottom under the river left rock that at low water can be paddled into.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Up next is the entrance to Drunk Tank. It consists of two 6 foot ledges, the first of which is a
low angle tongue and the second being a steeper ledge. The holes are not bad at normal levels but
it is imperative to be in control as an inadvertent run of Drunk Tank would not likely work out.
After these two entrance ledges boof 2 feet into the eddy on far river left right at the top of
Drunk Tank.
</p>
<p>
Drunk Tank is one of the big 3 on Linville and is the hardest of the commonly run rapids in the
gorge. It is a tight and powerful channel in the center of the river that drops 15 feet. The
first hole is sticky and scary and then the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/photos/archive/medium/11786.jpg">flume</a> drops down and into
a junky ledge drop of around 6 feet. The right side is a huge <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/photos/archive/medium/11782.jpg">impact undercut</a> that
could be a bad pin/hit, and the left side is the Drunk Tank, a nasty recirculating cave fueled by
the ledge drop. This one is dangerous, so know what you are doing and have a designated cave
buddy on standby. At high water the rapid can be snuck down the far left, which is normally the
portage route.
</p>
<p>
The very next rapid is a classic, and though I am not sure if it is named, I refer to it as
<a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/41289/">Diagonal
Chaos</a>. The river hauls down a bedrock rapid laced with diagonal ribs of rock that point
downstream, which create big curls and funky boils that throw the paddler this way and that. This
is one of the more out of control rapids on the run, but is relatively safe. Be mindfull that the
water drives through the pool at the bottom and into an undercut stuffed with wood.
</p>
<p>
After a class 3 ledge the river reaches a small blockage with a blind approach. Drive to the
right wall and turn downstream running a fun little 8 foot off vertical ledge. After a little
class 2-3 boulder series is the next big portage, where the bedrock disappears beneath large
piles of boulders. This character is what creates the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/photos/archive/medium/16382.jpg">next series of dangerous
drops</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/16380/">Death Penalty</a>
is a mandatory portage. It used to be possible to paddle way back into a crook eddy on the right,
shortening the portage, but wood has becomed lodged in there, requiring an earlier exit. Beach up
on the first log and then get out and carefully work your way to the back of the eddy up and over
a few logs. Finish the portage by dropping down a few boulders on the bank to river level. The
reason for portaging will be obvious from the pool below. In the runout there is a juiced up
version of Crack in the Rock on Chattooga, with a sticky little hole in the crack. You can putin
above or below this.
</p>
<p>
Below Death Penalty is <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/16410/">Tingle Balls</a>, one of
the highlight boofs on the run. This boof gets its name from the sensation felt from the frequent
flat landings that occur here. The right hand slot is a boat width wide and the line is to boof
the left side of this slot, being careful to get a good boof but to also keep downstream momentum
and angle. Its around a 7 foot drop. You are now in an eddy and are forced with a decision. The
next drop is right upon you.
</p>
<p>
After the Gangsta Boof you are in a hanging pool immediately above <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/photos/archive/medium/16412.jpg">Arch Nemesis</a>, a scary but
not too difficult slide down an undercut and overhung corridor. Flow coming in from the left
throws most of the water into a wood filled undercut on the right that could kill you if you
looked at it wrong. Drive left but back right near the bottom to avoid a hidden piton rock. The
other option is to sneak out the backdoor of the hanging eddy on the river right side of the
river.
</p>
<p>
The next rapid, Double Undercut, is one of the most disgusting rapids anywhere, and though once
the secret is figured out it can be run with ease, many still choose to portage, as the
consequences could not be worse. &quot;In your face&quot; would be a light way of puting things
here. The line is down the left side of the river and off of a 6 foot drop <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/16411/">landing in a shallow
boil</a>. You want to be far left here so as to have a good line up to drive back right behind a
badly placed rock in the center and away from a horrible undercut on the left. Yes it has wood in
it. It&rsquo;s also the first of three, with the next to being less deadly but certainly
menacing. This rapid used to be always portaged and though many make it look easy, it should be
taken very seriously. A portage can best be done far right hopping across big boulders to the
bottom. Daniel DeLaVergne pioneered a sneak down the middle but its not much of a sneak really,
with its own sketchy nature.
</p>
<p>
The next rapid is <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/16413/">Tony's Rapid</a>. Here
the line is on the left off a ledge that is parallel to flow. After landing turn hard right to
avoid an undercut and finish off a double drop bedrock feature. This rapid is named for Tony
Robinson, who went under a tree here once. The tree has since moved on.
</p>
<p>
Next up is a great rapid many Knoxvillians know as <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/11787/">Adam's Oof</a>. There are
3 ledges here. The top one is tricky as the river drives over a curl and off of a 4 foot boof
that has a rocky landing. This rapid is named for a Knox boater who landed this boof on his head
on the rocks below. The two runout ledges are fun and can develop big holes at higher levels.
</p>
<p>
The next rapid channels down the right wall and down a low angle slide that throws most of the
water into an undercut with a hydraulic in it. There have been many close calls here, but there
is a totally reasonable sneak further left in the center of the river. Just to the left of the
low angle slide is a vertical ledge of 5 feet. Boof it well as a rock lurks in the landing.
</p>
<p>
Jailhouse, aka the Hallway, is next. The <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/17587/">entrance</a> used to be
fine, but the floods of 2004 removed a rock that kept the flow out of the undercut right bank.
Though it is being run again, good water is recommended, as at low flows the line is thin and
manky. Start right and drive away from the right bank and into the slack water below. Or portage
the entrance on the left and seal slide back in off of the big sloping boulder into the pool
below. This moving pool deposits paddlers into <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/11783/">Jailhouse proper</a>, a
classic Linville rapid. Start right and either run the boof in the center or ride the wall on the
left. This drops into a hallway with a diagonal ledge at the apex of a sharp turn to the left.
After turning through here, eddy out above the backdoor of the rapid. This is a tricky move at
low water that consists of ducking through an undercut. At higher water the pool level raises in
here allowing a slot further left to be run. Even at low water this slot can be wheelchaired to
avoid the undercut shuffle at center.
</p>

</p>
<p>
This section has great scenery and some incredible rapids. Below Jailhouse though, the river
chills out and widens through some class 3 shoals with of course frequent bad undercuts. The
third shoal down steepens and finishes by driving off of a blind and sizable 7 foot ledge called
<a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/41291/">Cyclops</a>. The
right and left and center lines have good boofs, but beware a sticky pocket hole on the far right
wall. This is the clean line but get a good boof.
</p>
<p>
Right below Cyclops is the Low Water Portage. At good water the far left can be run through some
bouncy drops or the next slot to the left of far right can be boofed. It&rsquo;s real easy to get
out and take a look on the left, so do so. Portaging is accomplished from the left as well, down
a nice bedrock sidewalk. It should be noted that his portage sneaks up on people a lot. Look for
a big pool above and a nasty foamy eddy on the left where you get out.
</p>
<p>
The next series is high quality <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/photos/archive/medium/16384.jpg">class 3-4 fun</a> with
several great boofs and moves. After 150 yards or so this stretch culminates in a super sweet
ledge boof on the right, driving right. Below here is a little more boogie to Daniel&rsquo;s
Rapid.
</p>
<p>
Daniel&rsquo;s Rapid is named after Daniel Talley, who got flat pinned on the middle line. Hence
the popular line on the right that is alot of fun. Float down the right side and just before the
river sieves out turn left and drive towards the left bank through a slot that claps down on a
bedrock shelf in the center of the river. Slide another little bit into the pool below.
</p>
<p>
Right below here is a spot I refer to as the class 2 of death. Here the river drops a 2 foot drop
with a strong river wide backwash. The entire backwash goes under a rock on the right and not
paying attention here is a good way to die. Plane the hole with max speed being careful to
continue driving up over the shallow rocks in the lower part of the backwash. You will either
never notice this rapid or never forget it. Don&rsquo;t let your guard down on Linville. It can
be snuck to the right of the all consuming undercut, but if you can&rsquo;t make a move like this
in the first place, the trail out is on river right.
</p>
<p>
The river straightens out here and charges into the Cave Falls gorge, which is often the
highlight of any trip down Linville. Though the gradient is the most severe in the whole gorge,
the rapids are quality and memorable, with a few exceptional highlights. First is a rapid with a
shitty boulder jumble on the right and a secret door on the left. Drive left over shallow bedrock
to a spot that is similar to a mini version of the bottom drop of Mortal Combat on Raven Fork.
It&rsquo;s a simple slide down into the pool below, circumnavigating the often wood filled
boulder rapid on the right.
</p>
<p>
Next is a rapid that is just no good. It is after a nice ledge on the left. It used to be run on
the left. Now Jankasaurus Wrecks is quite sieved out on the left, but center has a stupid but
&ldquo;easier than getting out of your boat&rdquo; wheelchair line. Build up speed and charge
over the lip of a 3 foot ledge that drops onto a boulder. After this, drop the next ledge on the
left to avoid a nasty slot on the right, but angled back right to avoid unnecessary rock contact
in the bottom of this 5 foot ledge. After a couple times you figure out the trick and it&rsquo;s
not that bad.
</p>
<p>
Now you are at the most memorable rapid on Linville, Cave Falls. The river drops 20 feet at this
complex bedrock drop. The left has the classic line, a slide left into a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/11784/">6 foot boof</a> landing
on a slide where you try to angle right and catch a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/16421/">diagonal groove</a> that
zip lines you over to the far right side. If you miss the groove you harmlessly slide down the
left to the bottom, but if you catch the groove it is big fun riding the chute to the right. It
used to be possible to portage the first drop and simply enter the groove from a cave on the
left, but the floods of 2004 filled the cave with boulders, shutting this option down. Some
people portage the sketchy entrance, which is a bedrock slide angled back towards the right,
which is where you don&rsquo;t want to go. You can then <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/16374/">drop in right above the
boof</a>, still accessing the fun part of the rapid. There is a line that has only been run once
on the right, and it drops 20 feet down a bouncy and undercut slot into a big hole with undercut
pockets. The danger on this rapid is if you miss the standard line at the top you could end up on
the right line. Post someone with a rope just in case as it is easy to get out in the pool above
Cave Falls on the right and walk down. It also provides a revealing glimpse at the erosional
processes involved in this river.
</p>
<p>
Up next is a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/16388/">classic drop</a> on
Linville that I call Clapper Falls. There is a big horizon line and the center is the way to go.
In this center channel drive hard right and boof off the shoulder on the right heading right. You
will clap hard and slide down to the right where a hole waits. Punch through and finish back to
the center. Don&rsquo;t run the next drop, as it&rsquo;s the nastiest drop on the whole river and
to this date has never been run.
</p>
<p>
After a small 3 foot ledge folowing Clapper Falls, eddy out quickly on the far right, as the next
drop is not good to go. This is the Seal Launch Portage, a fun rapid to scout and an even more
fun rapid to portage. The nice thing here is that you get to bang down a 20 foot sloping rock
into the pool below, either by sliding in from the right or walking your boat down to the left
side and adding <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/17595/">a
little more freefall</a> to the seal launch. There is a rock in the landing over here, so take a
careful look. Boaters not wanting to risk the seal launch can portage far right and slide in at
the base of the drop.
</p>
<p>
After sliding in to the pool below the portage, you are committed to another <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/16387/">unportagable class 5
rapid</a>, but don&rsquo;t fret, its one of the best on the run. I call this one <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/16422/">Welcome to Bobs
World</a>, due to the fact that this rapid drops you into the most scenic walled in gorge that
highly resembles something Bob Ross would have painted. The rapid is somewhat obscured, but a
large midstream elongated boulder can clearly be seen splitting the flow. The line is to the left
of this boulder, first boofing a great shoulder and then centering up for the next sloping ledge
and chaotic sluice down through vertical canyon walls. At low water be aware that the right side
of the channel undercuts the midstream boulder and that there is a chock stone at the bottom of
the boulder pinching some of the flow back under the midstream boulder. Stay center and keep your
speed up here. At low water you will hit the rock, just keep pulling for downstream water. The
higher this one gets, the bigger ride it is.
</p>
<p>
Welcome to Bob&rsquo;s World drops you into the most perfect spot on any southeastern river, the
<a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/11785/">Bob Ross
Gorge</a>. Here the river is surrounded on both sides by vertical and overhanging walls. Upstream
all that can be seen is a sickening scene of world class rocks and water, while the view
downstream is of an end of the world horizon line with a perfectly framed <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/photos/archive/medium/16423.jpg">view of Table Rock</a>
looming high and distant above the gorge. This is truly an unbelievable sight to behold. At the
end of this 150 foot long pool is the big fun drop at Sandy Flats Trail known as Map Falls to
some and Dr. Shoosh to others.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Along with Babel Tower Rapid, <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/41292/">Dr. Shoosh</a> is one of
the few rapids in Linville that sees walks back up to get sloppy seconds. Here the river drops
down a perfect 15 foot slide with a huge hole at the bottom. Plane the hole driving center to
stay away from an eddy on the far right side that drains under a boulder. This boulder frames the
right side of the second drop. The second drop is a river wide sticky pour over that makes Hydro
on the Watauga look flushy. The good thing is that this hole is easier to punch than it&rsquo;s
northern brother, and the best way to punch it is to clip the right wall while taking a big left
stroke, once you are downstream enough of the upstream side of the wall where the sieve is. This
drop is always a lot of fun and is often the source of some good ole fashioned rodeo.
</p>
<p>
<b>-Wilson Creek Cameo through Spence Ridge Rumble-</b>
</p>
<p>
Below Dr. Shoosh, the gradient and boulder size drops a bit, easing the run up to class 3-3+ with
a handful of class 4 drops. This stretch is somewhat reminiscent of Wilson Creek, and is a nice
breather from the intensity found in the past 2-2.5 miles of hair raising whitewater. Keep your
guard up though, as there are still nasty spots. A key example is the rapid right below Dr.
Shoosh. Start far right and head diagonally back left to avoid a clump of deadly undercuts in the
center of the drop.
</p>
<p>
Next is a rapid that resembles Soc &lsquo;em Dog on the Chattooga, but with a junkier and longer
entrance and a pinch pin on the bottom right. Run the entrance through a tight slot heading
right, and then line up the wave train that drives right off the 6 foot boof. Launch a big one to
clear the hole, and don&rsquo;t turn right with the landing, as there is a pin spot. Keep driving
downstream.
</p>
<p>
The next half mile is fun class 3, with some scrape here and there. It is a combination of little
bedrock slides and boulder rapids. At the end of this stretch the river slowly builds back up to
class 5 for the last push to Spence Ridge Trail.
</p>
<p>
Near the end of this stretch is a fun little slot rapid called Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde, that is
fun on the left and death on the right. It is boat scoutable.
</p>
<p>
<b><a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/17600/" target="_blank">CLICK HERE FOR MAP GUIDE TO THE STRETCH CONTAINING THE FOLLOWING RAPIDS</a></b>
</p>
<p>
Following this slot is Adam&rsquo;s Wall, a straightforward slide down the left side that piles
under the wall blocking the exit. Run down the right side of the slide, careful to plane right
and away from the massive undercut wall immediately downstream.
</p>
<p>
Below Adam&rsquo;s Wall are the final 3 rapids above Spence Ridge Trail. The first is easier and
is run on the left, being careful not to get drawn into the side pocket on the left wall halfway
down.
</p>
<p>
Right below is Sodom and Gamora, a quality but scary rapid. There are two parts with a small pool
in between. The first part requires a strong drive from right to left down a tongue with
unpredictable currents and away from a sieve on the right. This automatically deposits you into
an eddy right above a 6 foot ledge. Spin around and peel back out center, boofing center. The
next part is a class 2 wave train that drives right into the biggest undercut on the river. There
is sometimes a line to the left, but it often has wood. More often paddlers run the narrow crack
on the right between the undercut and the river right wall. There are some tricky currents in
here and the tendency is to spin out to the right and to broach the slot before quickly being
devoured by the undercut. Hug the right wall, but don&rsquo;t drive in too hard as a spin out
could result.
</p>
<p>
After this intense drop, there are a few fun but sticky ledges run on the left, and then the
longest rapid on the whole river presents the last big hoorah before Spence Ridge Trail. Start
Spence Ridge Rumble on the left, falling down a sliding 10 foot ledge back to center. Then blast
a diagonal ledge hole that kicks left into a large undesirable sieve area. The run out is a few
good boofs ending with a tight pinch between a rib of rock on the left and a very undercut wall
on the right.
</p>
<p>
Even if you are not hiking out at Spence Ridge, this is a great spot to get out and take a lunch
break. Looking back up at the Rumble from the footbridge is very nice, and the dramatic view into
the inner sanctum of Linville, Cathedral Gorge, is both magical and sobering. The Spence Ridge
Trail climbs out on river left here, 1.7 miles to the car. The bridge crosses to the right where
a spur goes a short jaunt up to the Linville River Trail. If you are running out of daylight or
aren&rsquo;t feeling invincible. You can take the LRT a half mile down to Conley Cove, avoiding
the hardest and scariest whitewater on the whole river. It is possible to portage back down to
Cathedral Falls once past Twiggy&rsquo;s Revenge, but it is really difficult to do so.
</p>
<p>
<b>-Cathedral Gorge-</b>
</p>
<p>
Cathedral Gorge is the netherworld of east coast boating. The river narrows to half it&rsquo;s
typical width and drops through a gorge so tight that scouting is hard, and portaging even
harder. Running through here with a guide will make all the difference, as considerable time can
be lost stumbling around trying to see what&rsquo;s next.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned above, this gorge can be portaged in its entirety down to Conley Cove on the
Linville River Trail on river right, if you are running out of time and energy. Just take the
footbridge trail on the right 50 feet up to the LRT and turn downstream.
</p>
<p>
If you are continuing on, the very first drop below Spence Ridge Footbridge is Cave Diver. Many
sneak by bouncing down the far right to avoid the mainline on the left, which is a sticky and
melty boof with the whole pool boiling back upstream under the left wall of the gorge.
</p>
<p>
Right after Cave Diver is a great rapid. <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/41294/">Hallway</a> rides a fast
and bouncy wave train a ways down to where a rock splits the flow. Go right. !Check this rapid
for wood before committing!
</p>
<p>
The very next drop is run on the right charging back left to avoid a spot that has almost claimed
several boaters. The hidden sieve is better noticed in the pool at the bottom. This drop is only
class 3 without the sieve.
</p>
<p>
Next are two drops that are hard to scout and the first of which has a bad hole. Blind as a Bat
is on the left side of the river and as the name suggests is probably the hardest drop to look at
in the gorge. Boof center and give it all you got at the bottom, where the current bounces off a
big boulder and creates a nightmarish backwash. Right below the river drops down <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/41296/">Ribshot</a>, which is a
bedrock drop onto a rock in the center of the river that can sometimes throw you into the left
wall where rock sticks out.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the next pool is one of the toughest and scariest rapids that get run in the SE,
and is definitely the most gnarly in Linville. Known to NC boaters as Twiggy&rsquo;s Revenge, and
to TN boaters as Homey&rsquo;s Slot, this rapid has two lines. The main line is to the right of
the midstream boulder, where a curler filled spout drops 15 feet into a chaotic cauldron. The
spout has a cave behind it and the left wall of the room is undercut, with most of the flow
exiting underneath instead of through the exit slot. The right wall is sloped bedrock, making the
river right portage very sketchy. Portage high. The floods of 2004 made the rapid much worse, but
opened up a formerly sieved out line on <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/41298/">river left</a>. Its still
class 5, but not too hard, involving ducking the left wall and staying right, boofing a drop onto
a big hit and then out the bottom. There is no way to scout this one, so go with someone who has
been recently and realize that any solid flow could render this one back to it&rsquo;s former
sieve status.
</p>
<p>
Below here is a rapid that is easier than it looks. The river flies down a flume towards the left
of a huge bowling pin shaped rock. Drive right and eddy out right above the bowling pin and then
peel back out running just to the left of the boulder hugging the right wall. After dropping this
ledge get right, eddy out. Stay right here through a sneak slot to avoid a horrible hole on the
left wall, Terrible Hole. Terrible Hole is a nasty U shaped pour over against the left wall with
no chance of rescue. Cut back right immediately below the previous drop to sneak through a
corridor on the right.
</p>
<p>
Below here is the entrance to <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/41302/">Cathedral Falls</a>, the
grand finale of Cathedral Gorge. The entrance on the right is good to go only when the river is
at 2.2 or higher, so portage right if its low. Most of the river goes left here into some nasty
undercuts. But an easier and shorter portage exists around a manky drop on river left that puts
you above the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/41300/">left side entrance
rapid</a>, which is pretty cool. The entrance and the low water line both re enter the river left
channel above the Falls via a 5 foot ledge boof towards the left wall. After this boof, drive a
little more left and then turn quickly back right and drive the right corner of the falls to
avoid the hole at the bottom. Its either a big boof or a big meltdown on this one, your choice.
The bottom recirculates counterclockwise on the left, so staying on the right is preferred.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The river below Cathedral gives a first taste of the Lower Linville, with small but horrific
drops. The very next rapid piles under the left wall, so drive right and downstream with all
you&rsquo;ve got. Right after this is Nikki&rsquo;s Notch, a nasty rapid that funnels down
through a slot in the center of the river that is only 2 feet wide. Boof the right wall and get
your paddle sideways. The resulting pocket recirculates and both swimmers and paddles have
disappeared for varying amounts of time here. After the notch and subsequent boiling room, exit
through a surging slot on far left, as the center is sieved out. Portage right.
</p>
<p>
The final drop above Conley Cove is Surprise Funeral, a disgusting pile of undercuts where the
only doable line is far left banging down the bank. A prominent Chattanooga boater almost drowned
here one time because it doesn&rsquo;t look like anything from above. Just know that below
Nikki&rsquo;s Notch the only way to run the next rapid is on the far left.
</p>
<p>
One class 3 later and you are in a large long pool at Conley Cove Trail and camping area. The
trail is reached by paddling into the next class 2-3 shoal and eddying out halfway down on the
right where you can see campsites. Conley Cove leads out on the right a brutal mile and vertical
1100 feet back up to the car. The Lower Linville begins here and continues another 8.5 miles to
the bottom takeout at Hwy 126.
</p>
<p>
<b>-Lower Linville-</b>
</p>
<p>
There is some misinformation about this run, mainly that it is more reasonable than the upper
gorges. While the gradient is slightly less, the upper has lots of bedrock and clean rapids. The
lower is all boulder piles and this is where most of the sieves are on the river. Even the class
2 rapids have horrible spots that have scared the daylights out of great paddlers. This being
said, the Lower Linville IS NOT any less serious than the upper, so if you want to step it up,
this is not the place. This also creates a problem for paddlers running the whole river, who
after a long day already, are considerably worn down from the previous 4 miles of class 5 mayhem.
Mistakes are intolerable in this stretch. Many of the big rapids begin blindly at the bottom of
innocuous class 3 sections, with little to no eddies above them. The other issue is that the
Lower requires a bit more water to have a good boating level, as so much of the rapids are
dechannelized and sieved out. The next 2.5 miles are very similar to the Lower Rocky Broad, with
blind drops that are often not pleasant. Be patient and willing to scout when you can&rsquo;t see
the bottom.
</p>
<p>
After the long winding shoal below Conley Cove, the river begins its descent around and under the
massive boulder falls that have found their way down into the gorge from high on the cliffs
above. The first few jumbles are easier than what follows, and after a short distance things
begin to pick up. The first memorable rapid is a steep jumble that drops down the center of the
river with jagged piton/pin rocks in the way of a simple line. Below here for a ways the river
presents many rapids with similar scenarios. The lines are boat abusive and unpleasant, though a
great move here and there still exists. The big perk on this stretch is the awesome view of the
canyon walls on both sides of the river, especially the North Carolina wall on river left,
soaring some 500 feet high.
</p>
<p>
After about 1.5 miles comes the big 3 of the lower river. First up is a 12 foot spout against a
giant wall on the right. Its hard to get a good boof, but deep and surprisingly clean,
considering the other rapids nearby. Going deep is fun here. After a boogie rapid comes Twist and
Shout, a blind rapid that snakes to the left and then turns and drops 10 feet back to the right.
A huge tube-like boiling curl throws water back to the right at this turn and is a spot of
frequent carnage. Luckily the rapid has no major hazards and a recovery pool at the bottom.
Oftentimes boaters don&rsquo;t know they are here, only to make a last minute drive over the curl
into the river left eddy adjacent to the drop. The line from this eddy works fine too.
</p>
<p>
After a big pool comes the final drop of the big three and the last major rapid of the river. The
Wall is a large rapid that drives down a boulder field in the center of the river. Near the
bottom the flow channelizes into a powerful force that slams into a rock on the right. This
creates a huge curl that captures anything that floats into the drop and throws it back left and
off of a 6 foot ledge. This is a great drop, but scout it for wood first.
</p>
<p>
Below The Wall, the river continues at a high pace with several more nasty rapids spots to be
careful. After another mile of intensity the gradient starts to drop to the 100 ft/mile mark, and
after some occasional class 4 conditions for another half mile, the river slows to class 2 with
intermittent class 3 rapids.
</p>
<p>
The last 5 miles of the run are relatively low quality in whitewater, but the scenery is
absolutely fantastic, and views of Shortoff Mountain on river left will keep you occupied. The
last mile and a half to the takeout are less impressive, with many islands to figure out, and
second home development increases the further downstream one travels.
</p>
<p>
The takeout is on river right. By the time you get to the car, you will be quite tired. You will
have just dropped the Appalachian Mountains from the highlands to the plains though, and that is
an awesome feeling. Leave some dry clothes and food at the takeout because the ride back up NC
105 is long and slow. If there is still light on the drive back up, stop at the occasional pull
offs on the right to take a look into the lower gorge. The views are unbelievable, and you can
even see the tiny splashy river you were on hours ago, baffled by how big it seemed when you were
on it, and how small it looks now. The juxtaposition of big and small are nowhere better
exemplified than in Linville Gorge.

flow goes left to right to a very blind slot, which has a sticky lateral hole at high water. Wood<br/>
across bottom. Runnable with care, but heads up rounding the corner. Tony's rapid, shortly above<br/>

From Leland Davis:<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
Lat / Longitude from TopoZone. Gradient, mile-by-mile, from Rte. 183 to Rte. 126: 144, 50, 80,<br/>
80, 90, 150, 170, 240, 180, 200, 180, 100, 80, 70, 30, 40, 30, and 10 feet in the last 0.55<br/>
miles. That's right, boyzngurls: this baby's got 7 consecutive miles where the 100+ ft/mi<br/>
gradient doesn't let up! In that stretch of the Linville Gorge, it drops 1220 feet, averaging 174<br/>
ft/mile! Ho-lee Fudd! You'd better have your dancin' shoes on! The above mile-by-mile gradient<br/>
assumes a putin at Rte. 183. A more realistic putin, as Leland describes below, is below the<br/>
Falls; that takes 124 feet out of the first mile, leaving 20 feet in the first 0.35 miles. After<br/>
that, the gradients are pretty much accurate. &lt;a href=<br/>
&quot;http://webpages.charter.net/lelandd/paddle/&quot; target=&quot;newlink&quot;&gt;Leland Davis'&lt;/a&gt; description of<br/>
the run circa 2001, from his experience:<br/>
&lt;/p&gt;<br/>
&lt;blockquote&gt;<br/>
The putin is at the Falls, although we try to keep a fairly low profile there. The takeout is at<br/>
the bridge just before the lake. Yes, it is as intense as the (gradient) numbers look. Levels<br/>
should be 2.0 - 2.5 on the gauge just upstream of the takeout. I did it at 2.0 &lt;i&gt;(Streamkeeper<br/>
Note: This is the old level, this would be about 2.5 on the new gauge)&lt;/i&gt; and that seemed about<br/>
perfect for me. The first 4 miles is class III with a couple bigger drops, the next 10 miles is<br/>
class V+ in three gorges. The first reminded me of Vallecito in Colorado. The second gorge was<br/>
reminiscent of California creeking through granite bedrock, and the third was pure gnarly<br/>
Linville. After the third gorge there are a couple more miles of class V before the gnar lets up.<br/>
There were only 1.5 rapids that didn't get run by someone in the group. I did 4 portages. Good<br/>
fun down there--can't wait to get back!! We had a really strong group of 6 and it took us 7 hours<br/>
(we did break for lunch). Trip and I are hoping to get it down to 4 hours once we know the lines<br/>
a little better. Not a good place to get in trouble, though; it's a 2-mile, 2000-foot climb out<br/>
in the few spots where there are trails instead of cliffs. Scenery is an A+.<br/>
&lt;/blockquote&gt; </div>

As of 2003, the Kinstler Memorial Highway was a well-maintained dirt road, but a bit slippery after<br/>
a fresh rain. As noted elsewhere, there are many unrunnable sieves at low water. Low water means<br/>
much portaging. </div>

If you do venture into Linville, I would recommend covering up your body. The Connely Cove trail is<br/>
lined in places with stinging nettles and the river has some of the most poison ivy I have ever<br/>
seen. It is mostly avoidable but the scouts at the Clog and at the Wall involve some contact.<br/>
<br/>
I bring soap with me.<br/>
<br/>

The Linville by Chris Young<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If its not the best run that you've ever done, I'll drive shuttle for the next year&quot;<br/>
That was a promise I made to a friend who doesn't like long days on the river. The Linville River,<br/>
which runs through Linville Gorge in Western North Carolina, is where I initially made this vow.<br/>
Linville is the East's version of expedition boating. The run is 16+ miles long and has around 12<br/>
miles of non-stop class 5 action. In 1989 the American Whitewater journal listed &quot;the top ten hair<br/>
runs in the east&quot; with such other runs as the Lower Meadow and the Big Sandy. Some 15 years later<br/>
Linville hasn't given up that title. It was generally descended in two days until the mid 90's.<br/>
<br/>
The river begins at the base of a huge waterfall, the famous and scenic Linville Falls, and had a<br/>
couple miles paddle in before the onslaught. Once the rapids begin you will run or portage such<br/>
classic drops as Babel Tower, Drunk Tank, Twiggy aka Homey's slot, Cave, and Cathedral Falls.<br/>
Though, the run is not only a few big rapids, it is non-stop dangerous class 5 drops, one after<br/>
another for about 12 miles. There are more than enough stories about heinous swims, boats that are<br/>
gone forever down drainpipe sieves, and other troubles by some of the best boaters in the<br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
Of course with any run of this nature there are many tales. Has someone run the bottom of Linville<br/>
Falls? Has someone run the whole run in one day with no portages? There are two horrible sieve<br/>
rapids thataare4 thought to be mandatory portages, although some beg to differ. It seems like no<br/>
one can agree. One thing is for sure, when we got off the river that day my smiling friend told me<br/>
I didn't have to drive.<br/>

We got on the upper gorge and it surged close to 3' or so. It was an epic day to say the least. I<br/>
go back and still can't believe we did it that hight (1.9' being the perfect level). We ran mostly<br/>
everything except Cathedral (death hole @ high water) and one or two others. Carrying up Connely we<br/>
ran out of light, our headlamp battery failed, and we resorted to using a roll of TP as a torch.<br/>
One of my friends dropped his boat and we listened to it bounce to the bottom of the gorge. After<br/>
the TP torch gave out we abondoned the rest of the boats and resorted to flicking lighters to light<br/>
the way. We lost the trail and I thought for sure I was going to spend my first night on the river<br/>
in wet gear. Nobody was very pleased with that thought so luckily we found the trail and made it<br/>
out at midnight, twelve hours from the time we put on. The next day we hiked in and got the boats<br/>
and went to the Watauga. I have since avoided the Connely hike out.<br/>

abit about Linnville (more) New<br/>
Forum: BoaterTalk<br/>
Re: Anyone ran Linville Gorge, North Carolina? by mootg Apr 20 2001, 0:55 GMT New<br/>
Date: Apr 20 2001, 4:33 GMT<br/>
From: deluge<br/>
<br/>
Here is some spew.<br/>
If I recall correctly AWA did a piece in 1989 (yes'89) about &quot;the top ten hair runs in the<br/>
East&quot;. List included: suicide section LRC, Overflow, Watauga, Russel fork, Lower Meadow, Big<br/>
Sandy, Top&amp;upper Yough(as one), lower Blackwater (but Johnny R had done the upper for 4years),<br/>
Moose, and yes Linville. This was a year before the Green explosion.<br/>
<br/>
Hell there are races on five of these runs now. Race linville, I'll be walking alot!!!<br/>
<br/>
Clay did it solo on his 2nd run.<br/>
<br/>
Rumor Corran ran everything or didn't get out of his boat.<br/>
(smile Corran We are talking aboout you)<br/>
<br/>
They say it is 16 miles long. 2-3 miles flat water in the start and another 3-5miles in the end.<br/>
Not super steep either and almost pool/drop, but it is a long day if you do the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
There is a USGS N.C.guage at the takeout.<br/>
super low 1.5-1.6<br/>
low 1.6-1.75<br/>
medium 1.75-2.0<br/>
medium high 2.0-2.2<br/>
2.2+ watch out<br/>
(note have not done above 2.0 but gathered this)<br/>
guage being read at the end of the run since if you run shuttle at 7 am and get there 12hours later<br/>
it ususally is much lower and that is the water you were on.<br/>

Linville Trip Report (in 80+ degree weather) &amp; new rapid rating system New<br/>
Forum: BoaterTalk<br/>
Date: Jun 11 2003, 12:33 GMT<br/>
From: paddleman m<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, three of us put in at Conley Cove and ran the 3rd Narrows of Linville out to the lake. I<br/>
was in my OC1, Dennis in a C1, and Mike in a K1. Dennis has done Linville around 20 times, so he<br/>
made a good leader to show us the lines.<br/>
<br/>
What a beautiful place! The leaves were on the trees, flowers were out, clear water, beautiful<br/>
cliffs towering over us and cool looking rapids.<br/>
<br/>
What a wreck I feel today!<br/>
<br/>
First off, the carry in took 50 minutes and was a huge pain carrying a 14 foot canoe. But, Mike was<br/>
just as slow with his kayak. Some people carry out here, but why they would do that is beyond<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
The river started out with easy eddy hopping until we came to a more significant drop with a big<br/>
hemlock blocking it. That was our only carry of the day. It was also the beginning of the<br/>
sieves.<br/>
<br/>
This section of the river has more sieves that the Lower Meadow. In every significant drop, a<br/>
portion of the river was going under some boulder! I've run much harder rapids on other rivers, but<br/>
I don't think I've run any rivers that have so many sieves.<br/>
<br/>
As we got to the real rapids, our leader described and rated the rapids for our benefit. As you<br/>
know, we usually use a I-VI classification. Some rivers, like the Grand Canyon have a 1-10 rating<br/>
system. Well, apparently Linville has it's own system. The first rapid he described was rated<br/>
&quot;Nasty Sonofabitch&quot;. As we moved downstream, we were taught the rest of the rating<br/>
system. As near as I can tell, here's how it related to the I-VI system:<br/>
<br/>
III = Ain't Shit<br/>
IV = Sorry Little Bastard<br/>
V = Nasty Sonofabitch<br/>
V+ = MF<br/>
V++ = Nasty MF<br/>
<br/>
Many of these rapids came with a history of something that happened there, such as &quot;That's the<br/>
rock I pulled Bill and his boat out from under&quot; or &quot;We lost a boat into that seive<br/>
once&quot; or even &quot;Stay away from there, I almost died there once&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The water level when we put on was 1.65. That's as low as I'd ever like to see it. In the narrows,<br/>
there was enough water, but the wider parts of the river were painfully shallow.<br/>
<br/>
We scouted, set safety as necessary, and videoed a lot, so we were slow. But, even after the 50<br/>
minute walk in, the river took us 6 hours to run out. This is not your ordinary run, this is an<br/>
expedition. And today, I am more sore than I have ever been from a paddling trip. I shall continue<br/>
a treatment of cold beer application this afternoon. I'm sure that will help.<br/>

the deal with linville...<br/>

<br/>
seems like a lot of folks have been asking about linville lately, and there are some things that<br/>
need to be cleared up about this run.<br/>
<br/>
i've run a lot of rivers all over north america - many of them cutting edge class V+. LINVILLE IS<br/>
THE MOST DANGEROUS RIVER I'VE EVER BEEN TO!! it makes the lower meadow look safe. it makes the<br/>
lower meadow seem like the kiddy pool. there are many blind drops, and every rapid has a horrible<br/>
undercut or 10. almost every time i've been i've seen some paddler who has been down the raven's<br/>
fork, high water lower cullasaja, or who knows what other hair run with no problems get HAMMERED<br/>
AND HAVE A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE on linville. someone loses gear on almost every trip because if<br/>
you let something go, it will go under a rock and not be seen again. these events are not limited<br/>
to the upper - world class paddlers swim and lose boats on the lower as well.<br/>
<br/>
there are a lot of paddlers out there with the paddling skills to run the rapids on linville. there<br/>
are few paddlers who have the skill and stamina to scout their way down this run successfully<br/>
without mishap, and to accurately assess the dangers hidden at every turn. if people keep exploring<br/>
out there, someone will get killed in short order. don't let it be you. be sure of your skills and<br/>
ability to handle the sheer number of incredibly dangerous rapids that you will encounter in a day<br/>
out there.<br/>
<br/>
it's a beautiful place, and an incredible whitewater experience, but it deserves WAY more respect<br/>
than people seem to be giving it judging by the number of questions i've heard lately about putins<br/>
and takeouts.<br/>
<br/>
please be careful!<br/>
<br/>

ps. elvis has now left the soap box.<br/>
