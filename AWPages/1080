<h2>River Description</h2>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.duke-energy.com/lakes/levels/LakeMessage.asp?lake=summit">Last
Update</a>: 4/23/2014 4:10:13 PM<br>
Duke Energy has a maintenance project at Tuxedo Hydro that will take the station out of service
in early May with an anticipated return to service in mid-May. We intend to return one unit to
service as soon as possible. To facilitate this work, Duke Energy will gradually draw Lake Summit
down to approximately 95 feet prior to the start of the outage. Once the outage begins, the lake
will refill at a rate based on inflow.&nbsp; Please stay alert to changing conditions. Updated
lake levels are available any time at http://www.duke-energy.com/lakes/levels.asp and at
800-829-5253.</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Green Narrows is the southeast&#39;s most famous steep creek. It epitomizes a low-volume,
boulder congested, pool-drop character, with a couple of slides thrown in for good measure.
Unique in the fact it is dam released and runs roughly 300 days per year, it still retains the
feel of a wilderness creek due to the depth and inaccessibility of the gorge, the decent water
quality and fabulous landscaping, and the .6 mile walk downhill with your boat to get to the
put-in.
</p>
<p>
First run in it&#39;s entirety in 1988, and long after remaining a holy grail for whitewater
enthusiasts, the Narrows has been eclipsed by a few other commonly run creeks of greater
difficulty. Nonetheless, it remains the bread-and-butter of the Asheville area Class V paddling
scene, and is still a mighty big sandwich to bite into. Most of the rapids are tight and
technical, requiring precise boat control to run smoothly. Many of the boofs are not just fun,
they are mandatory. Boaters with <em>strong</em> Class IV+ skills who walk the Big Three have
been shown down successfully countless times now, and yet boaters with strong Class V skills
still get hammered here on a regular basis. Sadly, the river is the site of two fatalities and
countless other minor and major injuries. It is not to be taken lightly. The 100% release level,
with minor differences between 7-9 inches on the stick gauge, is &quot;the standard&quot;. While
a couple rapids get easier at 200% -- and there&#39;s nice padding at higher water -- most rapids
get <u>harder</u>. The time between rapids also gets much shorter, and the penalty points can add
up quick.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
During the historic <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/882790/">high water Spring/Summer
2013</a>, old gauge readings were tossed far past the woodshed, and instead of a &quot;Summer
100&quot; being 7 inches it was an astounding 13 inches or so, with round-the-clock 200% releases
being commonplace and running in the 19&quot; range on the stick.&nbsp; Splashy levels well into
the 20 inches were frequent, with several runs by the A-team (and the gripped) being had at 30
inches and beyond.&nbsp; See the &quot;Flows Info&quot; tab above for more information.&nbsp;
Truly remarkable and historic year.

<p>
Although running the Green is staple food ---a happy meal--- for regulars just trying to shut out
the noise and stay safe, it is also the daily training ground for many of the country&#39;s elite
creekboaters, and the annual <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18557/#brown">Green Race</a> is a
most revered and hotly contested affair. Held at high noon on the first Saturday in November
since 1996, it draws <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18589/">huge crowds</a> and even
a grilled cheese sandwich and/or hot burrito sales program. Another fabulous event, <a href="http://jerrysbaddle.org/">Jerry&#39;s Baddle</a>, a paddling &amp; bicycling biathlon fundraiser
held each Spring, is now in its tenth year and hugely successful as well.&nbsp; And, September
2013 was the first edition of the <a href="http://greenrivergames.com/">Green River Games</a> ---
featuring the &quot;Silverback&quot;, a triathlon gruel-fest of 8, 8, and 8 miles throughout the
Gamelands.&nbsp; The Summer of 2014 brings <a href="http://greenrivergames.com/?page_id=952">Rodeo</a> back as an exhibition Green River Games
competition in June.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, these events have a homegrown, homemade kind of
feeling, and reflect the strong and diverse community that has built up around the Narrows.
Seriously, you hear it or feel it all the time: <em>&quot;...man, I LOVE the Green.&quot;</em>

The Narrows is wholly located within the <a href="https://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/882899/">Green River
Gamelands</a>, a rugged tract of more than 14,000 acres along the Green River in Henderson and
Polk Counties. Owned by the people of the State of North Carolina and managed by the <a href="http://www.ncwildlife.org/about.aspx">NCWRC</a>, the primary purpose of the Gamelands remains
wildlife conservation and management.&nbsp; The 16 miles of trails (<a href="http://eco-wnc.org/images/greenriver_gamelands_map.pdf">pdf map</a>) are for foot travel only.
River otters, bears, deer, snakes, turtles, fish, and all manner of birds share this beautiful
place.&nbsp; Take note that camping is <em>not allowed</em> on state Gamelands.&nbsp; The nearest
campground is <a href="http://www.wildernesscovecampground.com/">Wilderness Cove</a>, a mile or
so past Fishtop.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Arguably, the Green&#39;s water quality has been going down over time thanks to the increase in
development upstream in the watershed.&nbsp; Following heavy rains the creek runs browner now and
carries more sediment from poor erosion control measures.&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo_detail_photoid_43107_">this picture</a> of
Toilet Bowl to learn more.&nbsp; Even without recent rains, sediment left in the creek-bed is
churned up every time Tuxedo is turned on, which means that early in a standard 5-hour release
the water is much cloudier than just a couple hours later.
</p>
<p>
Those interested in the early nomenclature used on the Green ---such as the &quot;Brain
Mirror&quot;, for example--- will enjoy reading Tom Visnius&#39; <a href="http://www.dusurf.com/vysniacraft/boofin_the_green">1991 notes</a>.&nbsp; Visnius, along with
John Kennedy, is normally considered as having the first full descent of the Green in 1988.&nbsp;
Also, the Green has lots of friends and you could be one of them:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1068977563&amp;ref=ts">The Green on Facebook</a>.&nbsp;
Finally, not every river has a holiday that&#39;s cause for true celebration, but the Green does
and it&#39;s called <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/882903/">Ladshaw Day</a>.

<strong>Dam Removal on Big Hungry:&nbsp;</strong> The NC Dept. of Env. and Nat. Resources
Wildlife Resources Commission issued a request for bids in late Summer 2011 to remove both dams
on the Big Hungry River, just upstream of the confluence with the Narrows.&nbsp; The upper dam is
visible from Big Hungry Rd. on the the way to Pulliam Creek trailhead, and the lower dam is
downstream and just a short ways up from the confluence with the Green.&nbsp; Removing the dams
will ultimately be a <em>great thing</em> for the river system&#39;s ecology, and will be no
small task.&nbsp; I&#39;ve started a separate page to collect information about the dam removal
process, and it&#39;s called the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/879790/">Big Hungry Topo Map And
Dam Removal Page</a>.

Current Parking Situation, April 1st 2014
</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Green Key Way:</strong> ...In order to access the Narrows put-in by parking at the
end of Gallimore Road, you need to use a gated and locked parking lot which is rented by the
Green River Access Fund. Keys for the &quot;Gallimore Creek Access Area&quot; (the parking lot)
cost $60 each. The cost for camps and commercial groups is $200.&nbsp; The keys run annually,
with the normal program being from April to April.&nbsp; Keys are now available at <a href="http://www.greenriveradventures.com/">Green River Adventures</a> in downtown Saluda at 111E
Main St.&nbsp; (828) 749-2800.&nbsp; More information, including how to order a key through the
mail, can be found here:&nbsp; <a href="http://greenriveraccess.com/">Green River Access
Fund</a>, and the Access Fund&#39;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GreenRiverAccessFund">Facebook page</a>.&nbsp; Green River Access
Fund, P.O. Box 792 Saluda, NC 28773.&nbsp; greenriveraccessfund@gmail.com
</p>
<p>
Use of the parking lot is for keyholders only, and is self-policing. There are NO other parking
spots at the end of Gallimore Road, save for two that are reserved explicitly for hunters and
fishermen across from the lot. You are subject to ticketing and towing if you park there as a
boater.&nbsp; Volunteers do the work at the Access Fund, your key is paying the rent, no
one&#39;s making a dime, and all boaters who access the Green here need to pony up the funds to
support the continuing use of it. Cheap entertainment.&nbsp; Keyholders are reminded to lock
the gate behind them each and every time they come and go, and to not let in people without
keys.&nbsp; Key purchases and other donations are tax deductible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The No Key Way:</strong> ...If you don&#39;t paddle the Narrows enough to warrant
buying a key, then paddle the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River/detail/id/1079/">Upper Green</a> first to
access the Narrows.&nbsp; No big deal.&nbsp; Alternately, to perform the Gentleman&#39;s Poach,
drop your friends and gear at the put-in trail and drive back around to Fishtop, getting a ride
back up as &quot;just a body&quot;.&nbsp; Some say it is legal (?) to park pulled off on Big
Hungry Rd. at the top of Gallimore, but the locals threaten towing if you park up there.&nbsp;
The best option is a nice little float on the Upper combined with the back-way scenic shuttle,
which wins hands down --- and is not much longer in total time.&nbsp; So, no problem if you
don&#39;t have a key.............just don&#39;t use the lot.

<p>
After putting in 100 yards above the confluence with Big Hungry Creek, there&#39;s an easy half-mile plus of class II-III warm-up.&nbsp; The gauge is located 200 yards downstream from Big Hungry, to your right at the top of a long pool.&nbsp; It was installed in the Fall of 2005, following the loss of the &quot;gauge rock&quot; back at the confluence.</p>
<p>
Then the walls close in......the bottom drops out......<i>and the fun begins</i>.&nbsp; Check out a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18604/">gradient chart</a> of the Narrows for an idea of where this gravity sport is about to take you.</p>
<p>
Enter Bride by going either between the two flake rocks at the beginning, or to the left of them.&nbsp; After the first drop of about three feet, there&#39;s a smaller pourover below which can make for a good playspot. Use caution after the top drop so you don&#39;t end up in the undercut on the right.&nbsp;</p>

From this set-up eddy, ferry into the entrance slot with some good upstream angle, catch the eddy straight ahead on the left.....turn and boof into the eddy below on the right....then ferrying out in front of the drop and around the undercut.</p>
<p>
(2)&nbsp; Race Line ------- This has a smallish double-boof/hump program then a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/882000/">squeezey entrance</a>. Stay right and slow down after that to feed back left into the race line boof finisher (shown in both photos here). Super fun to run clean!</p>

<strong>Johnson Branch </strong>-- Below Frankenstein, there are multiple lines through a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18418/" target="_blank">six foot drop</a> and then some&nbsp; boogie water on the way to Pincushion.&nbsp; Immediately below this drop there&#39;s a <em>tiny</em> feeder creek called Johnson Branch that comes in from the right.&nbsp; You can see it on <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo_detail_photoid_42048_" target="_blank">the topo map</a>.</p>

After the short stretch of boogie water with multiple routes, you come to Pincushion, a four foot drop with a blind entrance flowing into a pointy rock below and left of center. Enter the top slot on the left, line up and go right around the rock at the bottom.&nbsp; An alternate line is to take the bottom entrance and run to the <em>left</em> around the pincushion rock, but this requires more a bit more water than a low summer release to run clean.</p>
<p>
Below Pincushion is a two-drop Class III+ rapid with multiple routes available.</p>

Whale Tail begins with three different entrance slots and is a beautiful little slide with a two-foot drop at the bottom. Do <i>not</i> go over on the far river left side. A couple of small holes later and you&#39;re in the set-up eddy for Boof or Consequences.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
At 10 p.m. in near pitch darkness and paddling boats loaded with the infidel&#39;s favorite beverage, the committee has recently determined this becomes Class III-<em>plus</em> rapid.</p>
<p>
After Whale Tail things get pretty steep for a while.....this is the beginning of the goods.&nbsp; .</p>

<p>
Starting about here Mama Green straightens out a bit and drops head-long into the heart of the gorge.....the next five hundred yards drop at over 400&#39; per mile.</p>
<p>
The main line at Boofers is to stay with the flow leading in, wiggle through some squiggles, then bank right for the first drop (shown in the background of the above photo). Turn left for the bottom drop without getting pushed too far left or right (into an undercut or pin potential, respectively). There is a &quot;back door&quot; entrance to the main line that is sometimes done by people to get a better handle on the main drop if they haven&#39;t run it much, and it requires a little wheel-chair move to get it started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
For Boofer&#39;s sneak on the right, eddy out at the top and look for the slot just to the right of the midstream boulder. The line involves sliding through the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18060/">narrow slot</a>, catching just enough of a little flake rock, dropping about six feet and turning left in a hurry -- to avoid a personal introduction to a modestly undercut wall. Eddy out or re-enter the main flow for the bottom drop.&nbsp; While the sneak can be done all clean and fluffy-like, pinning/broaching dangers from getting too far left when dropping in are real -- and are briefly documented at the end of this fine <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LiK0VMDSjE">dawn patrol clip</a> from October 2010.</p>

<p>
Squeeze is the name for the sneak line at Go Left. From the eddy below Boof, hit the first drop going right, squeeze through the narrow slot and then pencil down four feet into a little pool.&nbsp; Cruise down the final slide of about ten feet where you&#39;ll need to head left to hit most of the flow and avoid a glorified seal launch --- especially at low summer flows (not a problem at <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo_detail_photoid_42387_">this spooky level</a>).</p>
<p>
After the pool below Squeeze and Go Left, there is a sweet little left-hand boof on the right-hand side of the main flow out.&nbsp; I used to think that this boof was about where you entered Polk County.&nbsp; But not any longer...</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"><b>The County Line:&nbsp; A Welcome Center Just for You?</b></span></p>
<p>
This next tidbit is pretty remarkable..... Looking at the Polk County GIS aerial photo reveals that the Henderson County/Polk County boundary line (as also seen here on <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo_detail_photoid_42048_">this USGS</a> topographic map) crosses the river almost exactly where the log is in Go Left And Die --- thus making the hole there at the base of the drop perhaps best called the <i>&quot;Polk County Welcome Center&quot;</i>.&nbsp; A tip of the hat to GIS sleuth Paul Bartholic for this one.</p>

<p>
Go Left is the first of the Green&#39;s &quot;Big Three&quot; (the others being Gorilla and Sunshine). Here, proceed down the same as Squeeze but head left instead of right. You then <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18347/">boof over a log,</a> skim merrily across a foamy plateau, and drop six feet <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/883406/">towards a narrow slot</a> at the bottom.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/387877/">Nice pic</a> here from the pool below.&nbsp; During the Green&#39;s first full descent in 1988, John Kennedy called this one <em>Orange Juice Squeezer</em>.</p>
<p>
Overall, Go Left is as good a place as any to pretty much have your shit together.&nbsp; Missing your line and hitting the right slot at the bottom is a fine way to piton before being worked, but passage is allowed over there too, depending. Plenty of Green Race carnage has been filmed here over the years by the folks at LVM and others.&nbsp; For example, a visit to the Polk County Welcome Center <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNS7CQIwuqA">can be dynamic</a>.&nbsp; Here&#39;s <a href="http://vimeo.com/16742710">another video clip</a>.&nbsp; And a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/879524/">somersault</a>.&nbsp; The rapid is normally (and easily enough) scouted from the right.</p>
<p>
Things change a little at high water --- and at really super-duper high water....witness <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/879309/">this shot</a> of Adriene running Go Left at 25&quot;, and a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=280027392166539&amp;set=vb.155908021245144&amp;type=2&amp;theater">sweet clip</a> at the modestly splashy 30&quot;-or-so.</p>

<p>At the end of the next little pool is Reverse Seven --- named (without inspiration) because it is vaguely similar to Chattooga's Seven Foot Falls, though a bit smaller and, of course, reversed. If not running direct you can catch the eddy on the left below Reverse Seven to get ready for Zwick's, immediately downstream. Running direct has the advantage of placing you in the flow towards Zwick's already moving, and sets up well for success. It's also more fun.</p><p>If you are going to scout Zwick's, most get out on the right before Reverse Seven Foot to do so, but you can also sneak into the back of the Reverse Seven Foot eddy and get out easily to scout Zwick's on the left. Worth doing if you haven't.</p><br>

<i>Top Hole at Zwick's </i></div><div>Photo of Andria Davis by Leland Davis taken 11/02/02</div></div> <br style='clear:both'>
</div>
</div> 
<p>
For many people, this is the first place to get worried. Zwick&#39;s consists of two real features: the top hole, as seen in the photo on the right, and the drop into the bottom hole <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18219/">shown here</a>. Enter the top center-ish with a little right angle and a big left stroke to power over and <i>beyond</i> the hole. Bank left and ride down the shelf following the main tongue of green water, taking a left-to-right boof at the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18053/">launch pad</a> over the bottom hole. If you get blown left at the top hole, stay left and run the bottom hole on the far left, not in the seam.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t underestimate Zwick&#39;s. Lots of good boaters have been hammered here --- as well as this author, who spent considerable time &quot;back in under&quot;, which a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/7543/">zero release</a> picture shows the potential for. What can compound a bad time at Zwick&#39;s is the fact that Chief lies in wait just 30 feet downstream and is in the outflow from the bottom drop.</p>
<p>
If you want, it&#39;s possible to sneak the top hole --- ducking in to the right just before the rock to Andria&#39;s right, above.&nbsp; The exit drops you out immediately below the hole, where you can then finish &quot;race line style&quot; or with the regular bottom boof.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Chief is one of the most dangerous rapids on the Green and is the location of the Narrows&#39; first kayaking fatality. There have also been a number of near misses here, so it&#39;s a good idea to exercise extreme caution in this straightforward looking two-drop rapid.</p>
<p>
The main line is center-ish off the top drop, pointing right and then heading down the main drop on the right side of it with a bit of right angle. Underneath the outflow of the main drop lies the infamous pin rock -- with a deep pocket to its right.&nbsp; This <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/7544/">series of pictures</a> at &quot;no release&quot; gives you a good handle on the bad program at Chief.&nbsp;&nbsp; Penciling in on the bottom drop while running the normal line can be highly suboptimal because you might pin in the deep pocket, with escape being something of a coin toss.&nbsp; A January 2011 incident during a <em>low water</em> run <a href="http://www.creeking.info/2011/01/beef-with-chief_13.html">details the potential here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Also, do not go off the drop sideways or angled left.&nbsp; Running left at the bottom (at juicier flows) might engage you in a &quot;not what you came for&quot; undercut cave-like situation, followed directly by an out-of-boat experience and then <a href="http://boatertalk.com/forum/BoaterTalk/1591903">beer and television</a>.</p>
<p>
At levels higher than ~8&quot;, a mid-river <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18770/">sneak</a> is available. However, almost all Green paddlers agree that the sneak is much riskier than the main line since it involves banging off a shallow shelf onto the rock that seperates the sneak from the main line. Hitting this rock the wrong way could send you backwards toward the pinning potential, which is exactly what happened during the drowning. If portaging Gorilla, catch the eddy on the left just above Pencil Sharpener.</p>
<p>
For kicks, here&#39;s a photo from upstream at a high water 25&quot; on the stick gauge.....<a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/879310/">don&#39;t try this at home</a>.</p>

Pencil Sharpener is the top drop of Gorilla. Many people run far right here, down a small slot that drops about eight feet. Others run a race line off the center or the double-drop &quot;<a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18587/">Flying Squirrel</a>&quot; on river left. Eddy out right or left to get ready for the next drop...The Notch! You can see the &quot;Birthday Eddy&quot; in the left foreground of this picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Like many rapids, Pencil Sharpener can be sobering to look at with <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/7546/">no water</a>.</p>

The Notch is is the tricksiest part of Gorilla. Although the flume is photogenic, The Notch is the crux move of the rapid. Here, the entire river drops through a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/880889/">196cm wide</a> slot with a big undercut (&quot;the garage&quot;) on the right, a boiling eddyline and the main drop of Gorilla twenty feet downstream. One can catch the river right eddy below The Notch (&quot;The Notch Eddy&quot;) to set up for the main drop, or go direct. The consequence of this move is Gorilla, so don&#39;t flip or swim here like one prominent local boater captured on another prominent local boater&#39;s homemade Green <a href="http://whitewatervideo.com/cgi-bin/WWVStore/Perlshop.pl?ACTION=Enter&amp;thispage=lowbudget.htm&amp;ORDER_ID=%21ORDERID%21#pby">video</a>.

<p>
Just before The Notch on river right is the &quot;birthday eddy&quot;, named for the much-loved and highly respected Daniel Delavergne.&nbsp; He caught the eddy on his birthday in 2006, just days before his death.&nbsp; A little memorial service was held a year later, and examples of people catching the eddy from that day <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rb1wdTl9LQ">can be found here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talked about, dreamt about, feared, respected, <i>loved</i>, and well-known the world over, Gorilla is a signature rapid like perhaps no other.&nbsp; And this Monkey raises the bar.</p><p>Many <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/16964/">great pictures</a> from interesting <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/15503/">angles</a> (including <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/877509/">this one</a>, and <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/877624/">this one</a>) can be found in the photos tab of the main page, and elsewhere on the web such as this <a href="http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=1215847263"><i><b><font color="green">best ever</font></b></i></a> video clip from <a href="http://www.lvmvideo.com/">LVM</a>. The main drop of Gorilla is sometimes called &quot;the flume.&quot; From the river right eddy in the Notch, peel out and a couple of strokes later you're ramping down to the pad and off the main drop of 16-18', headed towards the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18013/">Speed Trap</a>. Aim to be about two or three feet away from the river left wall for best results at Gorilla. Although the flume itself isn't a 5.2, the entire rapid, from Pencil Sharpener through Speed Trap certainly merits it. Over about 10&quot;, watch out for the Speed Trap as the flume gets easier and the Speed Trap gets tougher.&nbsp; Of course,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/877474/">at 19&quot;</a> the whole thing is just a walk in the park.</p><p>After landing Gorilla, it's not all fun and games until you get to the speed trap, as (1) you can't see, and (2) the &quot;face breaker&quot; protruding rock is 3/4 of the way through the run-out on your left if you're upside down. People huck themselves off the Monkey all the time, but the chances of something going wrong here are very real.</p> <p><img alt="" src="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/photos/archive/thumb/18523.jpg" style="position: relative; float: left; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 8px; margin-left: 10px;"/>If you're walking the Monkey, you can re-enter our beautiful Rio Verde via the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/879232/">well-known seal launch </a>(also seen <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/877707/">here</a>), sliding at a good clip down 30 feet of bedrock and dropping 6 feet back to the water-world just below the Speed Trap. Don't forget a boof stroke at the lip.....you're landing in about 6 inches of water, with Scream Machine immediately to your left. Above about 12&quot; on the gauge it becomes increasingly difficult to get right enough to avoid the hole in Scream Machine, so some people will pass on the seal launch and continue walking to the bottom of Nies' Pieces.</p><br>

The first of four slides, Scream Machine is a ten-foot drop below Gorilla. You&#39;ll want to ferry to the right at the top, but the current will blow you left, and you can end up right in the sweet spot in the middle-left. At levels above 11-12&quot;, the hole at the bottom left gets pretty beefy --- witness this photograph of a would-be screamer <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/881887/">taking his licking</a> at 19&quot;.</p>
<p>
If you catch the little eddy at the bottom right, look up and see a great hemlock growing right out of the rock wall. But you wouldn&#39;t have time at <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo_detail_photoid_42390_">this level</a>.</p>

<p>
At the top left of Scream Machine is a tricky little pot hole called the &quot;<a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18173/">Rock Star Eddy</a>&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

The final drop in the Gorilla sequence, run it either to the left side or right side of the big and slanted mid-stream boulder below Scream Machine. It consists of a double drop/slide on the left, or a big single drop on the right with a tricky boof (and a grabby hole at higher water). Probably more than half the people run left at Nies&#39;, with a bit of right angle to avoid the wall at the bottom -- and it would into mayhem during the now defunct <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18348/">Head-to-Head</a> portion of the Green Race.

Power Slide is a fun 30-foot slide with a beefy hole at the bottom. The standard line is to run center to center-right here at normal flows, breaking through a curler before turning left and down -- avoiding the meat of the hole.&nbsp; Some people plug the hole for fun-and-happiness, and sometimes they are worked-over as a result.&nbsp; Running left of the hole is an option, and/but swimmers on that side can have a difficult time of things.&nbsp; Don&#39;t assume someone in trouble there will be quickly delivered free of recirculation.</p>

A couple of short pools later comes Rapid Transit. Rapid Transit is the final and largest slide, but consists of broken ledges, a wall on the right, and a large undercut on the left if you drop off early over there.&nbsp; Deal with the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/881882/">large tree in the entrance</a>, ride center-ish down a shallow tongue of <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo_detail_photoid_40171_">green water</a>, engage the diagonal curler, avoid the crack along the wall on the right, and be-bop yourself on down what was originally known as the &quot;New Speedway Boogie&quot;.&nbsp; A great high water (25&quot;) photo <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/879312/">can be found here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The left line:&nbsp; dropping off the left side of the mid-slide <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo_detail_photoid_40172_">fist rock</a> pointing about 10 o&#39;clock left, facing nearly square-on the overhanging boulder before boofing right, can lead to a super-smooth line some are calling &quot;<i>Subprime Loan</i>&quot;, but it is a little tricksy and not without the hazards of possible foreclosure or rate adjustment.&nbsp; Right here is some <i>quality</i> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LiK0VMDSjE">headcam footage</a> that has a little Subprime in it at 1:08.</p>
<p>
Higher water provides an alternate entrance to Rapid Transit&nbsp; --entering another slot at the top left--&nbsp; feeding you back in just below the diagonal curler.&nbsp; It can be seen in the middle of this wicked nice clip from the LVM boys: <a href="http://vimeo.com/66090106">Do Not Feed To Cattle.</a></p>

<p>
The one trail out of the gorge proper is located on river left at Groove Tube. It is <em>very</em> steep for the first 150 yards, then turn left at the top of the steep section where it T&#39;s into the Pulliam Creek Trail. From there it&#39;s a mellow 2 mile walk uphill to Big Hungry Road, where you turn left again for civilization as we know it. <strong>Don&#39;t run the Green without knowing about this trail.</strong> Also, three rapids below Sunshine, at &quot;Triple Cracks&quot;, the Green Cove Trail terminates on river left, and using it to go downstream 3.5 miles to below the take-out is an option, but longer than the Pulliam Creek Trail. The Gamelands map, which does NOT show the short steep drop-off trail section to Groove Tube, is here in a <a href="http://eco-wnc.org/images/greenriver_gamelands_map.pdf">pdf file</a></p>

Don&#39;t wipe your face on the rocks along the left wall going down. Check out this <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18596/">picture of the left line</a> from behind the boater.

(2)&nbsp; Center-right Line:&nbsp; this line delivers a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/40138/">pretty swell auto-boof</a> right onto your plate, and lands you in the current heading towards Sunshine.</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re not running Sunshine, take your seat in the second eddy below Groove Tube on the right to portage or scout. Sunshine is directly below and pretty easy to wash into. Be sure you know where that eddy is!</p>

Sunshine is the Green&#39;s most difficult rapid and one of its most consequential due to the river <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18488/">pounding</a> over a 12-15 foot drop onto a broken rock shelf.&nbsp; Here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo_detail_photoid_43025_">nice angle</a> on the drop, taken from the portage route on river right.&nbsp; Late in 2010 the entrance (getting into and out of the set-up eddy) changed for the worse, making the standard line a fair bit tricksier.&nbsp;&nbsp; And check this <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/880676/">head-cam angle</a> from the top.</p>
<p>
Poor lines through Sunshine have caused countless injuries, including <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/250173/">paralysis</a>. Bring your A-game, recognizing fully the consequences of a bad line, or walk this one. Start your run of Sunshine in the river left setup eddy. From here, you will want to ferry across and with a great boof stroke, power yourself into the river right eddy below. Depending on how things go, you&#39;ll either catch this bottom eddy, with possible <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18081/">cave time</a>, or feed back left into the bottom drop.</p>
<p>
The alternate line here is &quot;<a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18080/">Sunshine Left</a>&quot;.&nbsp; It&#39;s very tight, scary to look at, and not done by a whole lot of people. Here are two excellent shots of the left line, <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/18120/">from the top</a>.&nbsp; At 200% and up, Sunshine gets run more or less right down the middle.....check this <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/880662/">29&quot; Richter-high</a> photo to see it.</p>
<p>
A careful observer will notice <i>why </i>Sunshine is named Sunshine, but <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo_detail_photoid_42048_">this topographic map</a> also explains it.</p>

<font color="green"><b><u>The Lower Section</u>:</b></font> After maybe taking a little break at Sunshine, there are no major rapids until the Toilet Bowl/Hammer Factor combination at the end --- well over a mile downstream. It&#39;s just fun Class III and IV, with a couple of long shallow stretches, and you&#39;ll be sure to enjoy all the tricky eddies, fun boofs, and alternate lines on this stretch of easier rapids. Some have names, and in order those are sometimes called:</p>

<p>
After the long pool following Baby Sunshine, there&#39;s a nice Class III lead-in with multiple lines and a couple different ways to run Toilet Bowl, which sports a decent-sized hole. Some people run top left and boof back right through it, but most probably boof right after angling down the main tongue feeding the bowl. With more water a far right line with a double rock bounce or one big boof works wonders. If you&#39;re not linking Toilet Bowl and Hammer Factor together, eddies await you on the left and right.</p>
<p>
For those of you prone to a little bit of potty talk, some eddies here are surely pleasant diversions on a Summer day.&nbsp; One is a tight little eddy <em>directly </em>above the drop called the &quot;Saluda Stuffer&quot;, which normally requires the stern of one&#39;s boat to hang out over the hole.&nbsp; It&#39;s seen this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCCOfK6SejE">this video</a> showing a couple different lines.</p>

<p>
Hammer Factor has an intimidating look to it with the huge looming undercut boulder on the right side, but is pretty harmless at normal release levels. There&#39;s a small set-up eddy that gives you a chance to look at most of it, and the eddy can be entered a couple ways, including a <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo_detail_photoid_43105_">fun boof</a> (levels above 9&quot;) when using the left-most slot. From that left-hand set-up eddy, the standard deal is to drop in, ride the curler to your left and get up on the shelf. The more shelf-life the better, as it skirts you around the worst of the hole. <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo_detail_photoid_43106_">Here&#39;s a nice shot</a> from the bottom of the rapid at 11&quot;,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/880384/size/big/">another at 8.5&quot;</a> , and yet <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/402082/">another one</a> from above at a guesstimated 30&quot;.</p>
<p>
At higher water it becomes more important to square-up to the hole once dropping off the shelf. Many people are spooked by Hammer Factor at high water, as stories of swims, and tandem swims, abound.&nbsp; Check this <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/880831/">head-cam photo</a> of Mr. Benedict dropping in at 16&quot;.</p>
<p>
An alternate line -- which looks harder than it is -- is the &quot;right line&quot;, and starts from the river right and <a href="http://brushymountainpublishing.com/rattler.html">rattlesnake infested</a> pool directly above the drop. Enter by boofing over or just left of a finger rock and aiming straight for the left wall, then continuing with the same shelf-life program as before. At the end of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5951483701969516844">this video clip</a> there are a few examples of the right line.&nbsp; Another alternate is briefly catching an eddy halfway through the rapid....called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=286560134846598">Fear Factor</a>.</p>
<p>
<strong>Danger:</strong>&nbsp; In late December 2011, a new sieve opened up at the bottom of the pool where that snake was (mentioned above).&nbsp; It&#39;s about 6-8&#39; to the left of the beach where one might take out there, and sucks empty-ish the bottom 1/4 of the pool/eddy.&nbsp; Do not stumble yourself too close for inspection, but boat inspections and regular right-side lines are easily enough done.&nbsp; It&#39;s big enough for a boat and feeds itself out under the main huge boulder overhanging the regular line.&nbsp; The &quot;shower room&quot; (accessed from the pool below Hammer Factor) is now curiously dry as a result of this change.&nbsp; Heads up.</p>

As an aside, in 1906 a pair of overly ambitious civil engineers from Spartanburg, SC (Ladshaw and Ladshaw) <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Photo/detail/photoid/882903/"><i>proposed building four dams</i></a> on the Green instead of the one we have today, and used a name apparently common at the time -- &quot;Fish Stop Falls&quot; -- for the rapid we know as Hammer Factor. Friends, let us rejoice that their plan was not chosen.</p>

<p>
After the nice Toilet Bowl &amp; Hammer Factor back-to-back combo-platter of goodness, your party is about over.&nbsp; There&#39;s a couple hundred yards of Class II, including one sweet little thing called Bitch Slap, and you arrive back at Fishtop.&nbsp; Take out on the small rock beach there, or run another stupid little rapid and enter another world.&nbsp; Alternately, and normally only done at higher water, go left around the island after Hammer Factor, passing the green wall, and arriving at the Fishtop Beach proper.&nbsp; Good for an occasional passing amusement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
For those interested in hiking up the 1/4 mile or so from Fishtop parking to Hammer Factor, there is an easy trail on river right that isn&#39;t too hard to find --- and then with some modest clamboring about one can wind up on the boulder overlooking the drop (above right).</p>
<p>
<font color="red">Be careful with your sports beverages at Fishtop --- they are kinda-sorta illegal in the parking lot, depending.&nbsp; Truth be told, they are illegal anywhere in Polk County within 50 ft. of the river.</font></p>

<u>Some Thoughts on Safety</u></h2>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Because the Narrows is paddled regularly year round --- and on a Summer weekend can seem downright crowded, there is a tendency by some people to let down their guard and take it for granted. There is also a not un-common opinion that &quot;anybody&quot; can get down the Green if they are halfway capable, and new people occasionally step up to the Green before they are ready to. Things can turn into a shit-show in no time. Two people who were qualified Class V boaters actually died here. Many many others have been injured, sometimes seriously, with one of them being paralyzed for life. Nearly all of these people surely belonged on the Green, and yet things went tragically wrong.</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have the answers; that&#39;s not my game. YOU need to think about it and talk about it. I&#39;d at least suggest you have a few of the basics down pat; namely, full safety equipment, a first aid kit, whitewater rescue training or knowledge, familiarity with the terrain and trails, truly solid paddling skills, and the ability to go to Plan B without freaking out. Finally, what perhaps is difficult to teach is the ability to keenly observe and act with clarity, speed, and aggression when trouble is brewing for someone else.&nbsp;Think about --visualize-- <em>being that guy</em> for someone.&nbsp; For inspiration, check this <a href="http://vimeo.com/72792859">now famous save</a> from Dave Fusilli out in Washington state.</p>
<p>
This little box is here to keep the bug in your head that paddling Class V creeks is serious business. Although the Green is seen as relatively forgiving compared other more dangerous creeks, as my friend Kirk Eddlemon says elsewhere about another run, the Narrows can (and will) still call your bluff. Yeah it&#39;s fun and all --- the kind of fun that hooks you and you just can&#39;t get enough --- but step off your game for a moment and things turn south in a heartbeat. Trust me, I know.</p>
<strong>Backboards:</strong> There are now two backboards at the Green in case an evac is necessary.&nbsp;There is one at Gorilla on river left, visible and tied to a tree but out of the way.&nbsp;The other is on river right and is hidden from view, not far from Sunshine.&nbsp;Most Green locals know where this one is.</div>
