<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">LENGTH: 48 miles, (3 days / 2 nights)</span>
</p>
<p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">RECOMMENDED BOAT TYPE: Kayaks and IK&rsquo;s. Not suitable for
rafts or even small catarafts.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">DIFFICULTY OF RAPIDS: Continuous Class II increasing steadily
to continuous Class III; several short Class III+ or Class IV- drops easily
portaged.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">HAZARDS: This run is not for novices; it contains many tree
blockages, debris piles and sweepers, often located on blind tight turns in fast-moving Class III
water. We portaged a number of river-wide tree jams and took sneak routes around and under at
least a dozen other blockages that we would have had to portage if we were in IK&rsquo;s. The
waters are frigid on the upper section of the river. Much of the river&rsquo;s banks are lined
with brush or small trees whose low branches hang out over the water, at about the height of a
kayaker&rsquo;s head, often interfering with maneuvering and making it difficult to eddy out.
Springtime high water undermines some of these small trees which then collapse across the stream
and block it. The river frequently divides into channels around small trees growing in the
streambed, splitting the river into shallow channels with one or both channels clogged with
debris. At the beginning of the run,</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Joseph</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">is only about
10-15 feet wide and 12&quot; deep (using my paddle blade as a measuring stick). It gradually
grows in size from the half dozen small side streams coming in so that it is about 20-30 feet
wide and about 24&quot; deep at it&rsquo;s confluence with the Grande Ronde. (See comments below
for estimated depths at higher and lower flows.) The hydraulics don&rsquo;t have enough punch to
knock over an experienced kayaker; however, the river is so shallow that you are constantly
bouncing off the bottom and it would be easy to get banged up doing a roll in the shallow water
if an unexpected boulder caused an upset.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">SEASON:</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Joseph</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">is only boatable
during a brief two- to three-week window in April or May immediately after the snowpack in the
surrounding</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Joseph</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">drainage melts. The river
drainage covers a relatively small area and lies at a modest elevation of around 4,500 feet or
less, so the snowmelt occurs sooner than most people think and does not last very long. It is
difficult to plan a trip because the season is so unpredictable. Historical hydrographs dating
back to 2004 are available on the Washington State Dept. of Ecology website.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">GRADIENT: 50 feet per mile. The current is fast and continuous,
there are no pools nor eddies nor flat sections, nor are there any drops that produce fun rapids.
The river speed is astounding; we boated the 48 miles of river in a little over 11 hours
including portages and scouts, averaging about 3 mph on day 1, increasing to 3.7 mph on day 2,
and increasing again to 5.2 mph on day 3.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">CHARACTER: This is a rarely boated river, located in a very
remote and isolated deep canyon--forested at the put-in, changing to semi-arid high-desert at the
take-out. The attraction is its remoteness, not its whitewater. If you are interested in running
whitewater, there are many better and logistically easier rivers than this
one.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">LAUNCH ACCESS: There is no public access point at the put-in.
Nearly all the property on both sides of</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Joseph Creek
Road</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, the access road, is privately owned and there is a
locked gate about 6.5 miles downstream from its intersection with Road #5020. The Wallowa Whitman
National Forest map shows a single small strip of public land on both sides of the road extending
to the river, located about 4.25 miles downstream from the intersection with Road #5020, which is
where we launched. I called the Forest Service office at</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Enterprise</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">prior to our trip and
was advised to stop and talk to the local rancher(s) along the access road and ask permission
before launching.&nbsp; As we drove in, we met Tom Birkmaier, who owns the upper ranch
along</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Joseph</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">; he gave us directions on
where to launch and asked for a copy of my trip report when we were done because he is interested
in boating the river someday. (Tom and his family live on the property which is too remote to
have phone service, so it is not possible to contact him ahead of time to ask permission.) After
the trip, I spoke on the phone with Dub Darneille, the owner of</span> <a href="http://www.ninebarkoutfitters.com"><span style="font-family: Arial;">NineBark
Outfitters</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;">, which has the property behind the locked
gate at the end of the road. Dub says that kayakers must obtain permission from him before
boating through his property, which he has granted in the past, but only if they ask beforehand
and if they sign his standard release form. Dub lives in Joseph, not at the ranch behind the
locked gate, so he has both email and phone access and can be contacted ahead of time by email
at</span> <a title="mailto:ninebark@oregontrail.net" href="mailto:ninebark@oregontrail.net"><span style="font-family: Arial;">ninebark@oregontrail.net</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;">, or
by phone at 541-426-4855. Dub strongly discourages trip reports such as this one because he fears
it will trigger more boat traffic and eventually lead to potential conflicts between kayakers and
landowners. I too share his concern, but feel the stream is more hazardous than most kayakers
believe and they need to have the information.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>

&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">CAMPING ACCESS: Although</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Joseph</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">is a designated &ldquo;Wild and</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Scenic</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">River</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&rdquo;, nearly all of the land in the bottom of</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Joseph</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Canyon</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">is privately owned by ranchers who have run cattle and maintained a handful
of cabins along the river for generations since it was homesteaded in the early 1900&rsquo;s.
The</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Wallowa</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Whitman</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">National Forest</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">map suggests that only about 12-15 miles of the river bank is
in BLM or US Forest Service ownership, and these miles are spread out in bits and pieces and
difficult to identify as you paddle past. From the point of view of the landowners,</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Joseph</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">may not meet the legal requirements of a navigable river, in
which case the public would not have an inherent right to kayak though the privately owned
sections to get to the publicly owned sections. The ranchers are well aware of boat traffic down
at the bottom of the remote canyon--we passed two horseback riders and an ATV carrying two people
along the section of river accessible by way of the Paradise pack trail, and Dub Darneille knew
within a few days that two kayakers had hiked in down the Paradise pack trail the prior weekend
and boated the lower half of the river. The point is that <b>boaters should exercise discretion
and attempt to camp on public land</b> if they can figure out where it is, and when they
encounter a local, to be polite and recognize they are treading on thin ice because they are most
likely trespassing on someone&rsquo;s land.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial;">TAKE OUT ACCESS: The take-out we used is a public park on river
left on the</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Grande</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Ronde</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">River</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">about 2 miles downstream from the confluence with</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Joseph</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">and a mile or two from the confluence with the</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Snake River</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. Our shuttle service
says this parking area is safe and they use it routinely for their summer shuttles for boaters
doing the lower section of the</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Grande</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Ronde</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">River</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. Note that you need to buy a
state of</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Washington</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">parking pass to park in any of these areas. We passed another public
parking area on</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Joseph</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">about a mile or so upstream
from the confluence, which would shorten the trip by a few miles if you took out there, however
it may not be as safe to leave your car there overnight.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial;">SHUTTLE: Boggan&rsquo;s Oasis did our shuttle, located where
Oregon Highway 3 crosses the</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Grande</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Ronde</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">River</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">about an hours drive north of</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Enterprise</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.&nbsp;The
owners/managers are Bill and Farrel Vail, contact them by phone at 509-256-3372 or email
at</span> <a title="mailto:boggans@valint.net" href="mailto:boggans@valint.net"><span style="font-family: Arial;">boggans@valint.net</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;">. The have
done shuttles on the</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Grande</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Ronde</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">River</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">for years, but had never done a shuttle on</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Joseph</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">until us, which gives an indication of how rarely</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Joseph</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">is boated.&nbsp; We paid $160 for the shuttle and felt it was well worth
it. Our shuttle driver was Dell, about 70+ years old, whose grandparents homesteaded in
the</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Paradise</span> area; his father made a living
trapping and so did Dell up until WWII. Dell knew the history of every homestead and kept us
entertained with stories during the 1-hour drive in. Note that the shorter Elk Creek road in was
blocked by snow about 2 miles from its turn off of Highway 3, so we had to drive to Enterprise
and then take the longer way in by way of Crow Creek Road.

<span style="font-family: Arial;">NO PACK TRAIL: The map shows a pack trail starting at the
locked gate and winding its way down the canyon and crisscrossing the river frequently using low
water fords. At the trip beginning we did see a trail along the river down as far as Swamp Creek,
but I don&rsquo;t think there is no way for the public to access the trail because of the locked
gate at the end of the road. We did see an ATV trail crisscrossing the river in the</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Rush</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">area (private property), apparently heavily used in the summer
at low water and accessed by dropping down off the rim from above. I asked the forest service
about the trail and was told that much of the trail has disappeared over the years, it has not
been used or maintained and public access is difficult...the only access is from on top from the
Chico trailhead. After we passed by Tamarack Creek, the canyon walls closed in and there was no
evidence anywhere of a way to walk down the canyon, unless you walk down the middle of the stream
bed at low water. So if you get in trouble below Tamarack Creek, the only way out is to climb the
canyon walls 2,000 to 3,000 feet to the top.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial;">RIVER LOG:</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><u>Mile 0</u> Put-in on shoulder of road next to creek on
publicly owned stretch of land, after talking to local landowner. The next 5 miles are meandering
shallow stream among the willows in privately owned ranchland. Within a mile of the put in, we
encountered a log blocking the river which we could pass under at one end. This was followed by
numerous partial blockages including a small beaver dam which we passed over. No whitewater in
this section, fairly slow speed. Boring.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><u>Mile 4.8</u> Pass under bridge to NineBark Outfitters, ranch
buildings on both sides, we are now downstream of the locked gate.&nbsp; Private property on both
sides of river for the next &frac34; mile according the USFS map, then public land almost to
Swamp Creek. In this next section of the river we had to portage around one log that blocked the
river and snuck around 2-3 partial debris blockages. Shallow, hit lots of rocks, average depth
about 12&quot;, river is about 10-15 feet wide. Water is frigid. Beautiful stands of tall
ponderosa pines on grassy benches along the river that would make wonderful lunch or camp spots.
Very scenic, class II water, pleasant boating in the forest.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><u>Mile 10.0</u>&nbsp; Swamp Creek on left. Private property on
both sides of river, NineBark Outfitters cabin on left, abandoned barn on right, intermittent
private and public lands next 3-4 miles according to USFS map. Swamp Creek adds enough water that
the river is a few inches deeper and moves a bit faster. Continue to encounter partial blockages
from debris and wood.&nbsp; Narrow winding river canyon with poor down steam visibility in many
places from overhanging branches. Saw two groups of mountain sheep, bald eagles, hawks, ducks and
deer. From memory (not on my notes) I think there is a log across the river about 5 miles below
Swamp Creek that we were able to pass under. About 6 portages to get to this point if we were in
IK&rsquo;s, only one if in kayaks. Overall very scenic, class II water, easy boating other than
dealing with the debris and wood.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><u>Mile 15.5</u> Abandoned and collapsed building on right with
shiny metal roof visible through the brush, old farm implements (rake, plow, wagon bed) on river
left, not clear from USFS map whether public or private property, assume private. 5 hours on the
river (excluding lunch stop) from put-in to get to this point, average speed 3.1 mph despite
portage and very slow water at beginning. Canyon has opened up a bit, no more tall ponderosa
pines, becoming more arid and open as we drop in elevation, nice flat grassy benches along river
in many places.&nbsp; From this point downstream to</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Rush</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, we encountered 3-4 log jams, portaged one and should have portaged
another that involved somewhat tricky move. At about mile 16-17, we encountered a sharp drop
where river turns 90 degrees and crashes into the wall on river right in a tight turn&hellip;.the
first true rapid we encountered on the river. Stopped to scout and decided to just drag boats
around instead of spending time to climb the steep bank and do a proper scout--could have run it
in hindsight after seeing that the downstream runout was clear of debris. Also in this section,
or perhaps in the section below (my notes are not clear), we encountered two more short drops,
one where river crashes down into large boulder(s) on river left forming a boulder sieve, another
with logs and large boulders clogging up the river. We found sneak routes around both, did not
scout. From this point all the way to the take-out, have to fight overhanging branches and poor
downstream visibility on tight turns with debris and brush. Class II whitewater overall, other
than the specific drops mentioned, not difficult from a whitewater
perspective.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><u>Mile 16.6</u> Old camp trailer visible on right bank. Just
downstream on river left, a trail winds down from the rim 2,500 feet above and joins the well
used ATV trail which runs downstream all the way to</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Rush</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. (Wonder if the camp trailer somehow was towed down that trailhead years
ago?) The marks on the river banks beginning at this section of river are where ATV&rsquo;s climb
in and out of stream bed as they ford the river in the summer.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><u>Mile 17.8</u> Peavine Creek enters on
right.</span><u><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"><br></span></span></u>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><u>Mile 26.7</u> Rush Creek enters on river right just
downstream of a nice fenced cabin located on river left, which had two saddled horses in front
yard as we went by.&nbsp; Abandoned two story farmhouse on river right at mouth of</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Rush</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">on private property. The map shows another trail coming down
from canyon rim 2,500 feet above on river left across from</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Rush</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, but we did not see it. The ATV trail peters out 3-4 miles below</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Rush</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. After Rush Creek, river
becomes continuous class III whitewater with interludes of class II+, very technical pushy water,
lots of boulders, overhanging branches, water up the tree trunks on shore, logs and debris hung
up frequently in mid-channel and on trees, very dangerous section, must pay attention, but only a
couple of spots where hydraulics have any punch, not big water. Average water depth has increased
to about 24&quot; because of added flow from side streams and river velocity has increased
significantly.&nbsp;River is perhaps 15-20 feet wide. Water is not as frigid as at put-in. ATV's
passed by twice on opposite bank carrying two people, we waved to each other. ATV trail looks
heavily used in</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Rush</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Creek</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">area. Water is currently too
high for ATV's to cross the river, so they are stuck traveling up and down the west bank until
water drops. On river left about 2 miles below Rush Creek where river makes hairpin bend on map,
watch for a small warm springs dripping down the left bank marked by lush green plants, the
remains of an old rock enclosure around the spring source are about 20 feet up on the steep bank,
located at the edge of the barbed wire fence line, it's all tumbled in and nasty/mucky from heavy
use as a wallow by cows and elk.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><u>Mile 32.4</u> Tamarack Creek enters on river right. The next
9 miles of river are my favorite; this is the only section with no evidence of people or trails
and is the only truly remote and inaccessible part of the canyon. The USFS map shows private
property from the mouth of Tamarack Creek downstream about 3 miles, public property then begins
and continues all the way off the margin of the map into the State of</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Washington</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. The canyon gradually
narrows as you move downstream from Tamarack Creek and becomes steeper with sections of vertical
rock wall for the first time on the trip; there is no evidence of any trail on either side of the
river. <b>It would not be possible to walk out along the river banks for help if you got in
trouble.</b> If the Nez Perce Indians used this canyon as their annual migration route for
hundreds of people and livestock, they must have walked up the river bed at low water or just
bypassed this section of canyon. We camped on river left at river mile 35.8, about 4 miles below
Tamarack Creek, on a lush grassy bench next to the river. We passed terrific campsites on both
sides of the river beginning about midway down this section. Saw wild turkeys, eagles, river
otters and fish jumping. Beautiful warm weather. The added flow from Tamarack Creek and
narrowness of the canyon causes the speed to increase yet again and produces fun continuous Class
III water from here to the bridge, but the rapids still lack punch and there was no risk of being
knocked over. We paddled the 12.1 miles from our camp to the takeout in 2.3 hours for an average
speed of 5.2 mph in this section. We encountered two more trees across the river, found a sneak
route around one and had a near disaster on the other one. The river spits around a midstream
island and we took the left channel, mistakenly thinking the tree blocking the channel did not
extend all the way to the bank. It did. I managed to jump my kayak over the mostly submerged tree
trunk, then paddle back and grab the nose loop on my companion&rsquo;s kayak which was stuck on
the tree and yank him across before he was pinned. In this section there are many small islands
dividing the river, with one or both channels full of wood, blind corners, tight turns and low
visibility from the overhanging branches, with little time to make choices because of high speed
of river. You should not commit yourself down any blind corners in this section unless you can
see an eddy to safely stop in should the channel turn out to be blocked with
wood.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><u>Mile 41.2</u> Bridge over River. Beginning of agricultural
land which runs on both sides of river from bridge to confluence with Grande Ronde. Encountered a
tree blocking the river in this section just upstream of next bridge and dragged our boats around
blockage. Saw large herd of elk (about 70 head) crossing river in front of us, about 100&rsquo;
away.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><u>Mile 43.7</u> Bridge over River and parking area on right
bank. Potential place to leave car. The two miles from this bridge to the confluence with the
Grande Ronde are fun class III water, would be a good training ground for local beginning
kayakers.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><u>Mile 45.6</u> Confluence with</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Grande</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Ronde</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">River</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. Nice wave trains on
corners, class II to takeout. Saw eagle in tree.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><u>Mile 47.9</u> Takeout at parking area on river left. Car is
easily visible from road, lots of homes nearby to provide sense of security.</span>

Ken's review is accurate. I would like to emphasize a few points. Expert boat control and some luck<br/>
are required to make it through the frequent wood hazards. Some spots combine running a class<br/>
(III-IV) rapid, plus avoiding a river wide log jam, plus navigating through groves of small trees<br/>
actually growing in the river channel, all at the same time. Also, as mentioned, careful prior<br/>
coordination with land owners is required for access to avoid conflict. Finally, the river moves so<br/>
fast that it is very difficult to find public property for camps without a GPS and pre-entered<br/>
waypoints. Have fun. Be safe! </div>

I've run Joseph Creek 3 times and with proper care and handling, have had cooperation not conflict<br/>
the local landowners. Trespassing is not an option and you need to respect their land. As far as<br/>
wood goes, there was plenty of warning in these reports - so take heed!. Class IV skills and safety<br/>
procedures needed for a safe run. </div>

Ran Joseph Creek April 16-17, 2011. Flow was dropping from 2100, highest ever flow I've seen.<br/>
Launched at 550, took out at 925 after heavy rain the first night. Much wood has been re-arranged.<br/>
there used to be 2 portages above Swamp creek, these were now runnable. In the section from Swamp<br/>
to Peavine Creek, we had 3 portages. the first 2 were fairly obvious and quick, short portages. The<br/>
third was where the old mobile home is visible on river right. A tight bend to the right with a<br/>
large midstream boulder creates 2 narrow channels, both blocked with wood. Longer portage via the<br/>
old road bed. Many many more strainers and logs, but nothing requiring portage at these flows.<br/>
Several were river wide and would require portage at lower flows though. One other very significant<br/>
hazard 1 mile above the 2nd bridge (where the gauge and takeout are located). A fish trap in the<br/>
river looks runnable, but 2 nearly invisible cables are across the river and only about 4&quot; off the<br/>
water. Very dangerous. This is a great run, though it is not for class III boaters. the water is<br/>
continuous, as is the wood, and swimmers will need to self-rescue. One of my favorite trips<br/>
anywhere. </div>
