<h2>River Description</h2>
<p>
<b>Quick Facts:</b><br>
<br>
Location: Glendale/Milwaukee, starting about 4.5 miles north of downtown Milwaukee, ending 2
miles northeast of downtown.<br>
Shuttle Length: 3.8 miles. (See details in &quot;Directions&quot; Tab.)<br>
Character: The (relatively) deep, tree-surrounded river corridor creates a green oasis in the
city. Rocky shoals, bedrock ledges, an old timber dam, and paver-block remediation create random
areas of riffles, rips, and minor rapids.<br>
<br>
Put-in is approximately 610&#39; elevation.<br>
Take-out is approximately 580&#39; elevation.<br>
Thus total elevation change is approximately 30&#39;.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
I believe this stretch of river gets a (largely unfair) bad reputation regarding water quality
due to media harping on the MMSD every time there are CSOs (Combined Sewer Overflows). In spite
of the &#39;deep tunnel project&#39;, millions of gallons of untreated mixed rainwater and sewage
may be dumped into area rivers at times of heavy rains. At one site alone, there are pumps
capable of contributing <strong>250 cfs</strong> (~6.73 million gallons per hour!) into this
river upstream of our listed put-ins. I feel it is even more important to note that even absent a
CSO, <strong>street and lawn runoff (especially after a significant period without rain) contain
extremely high levels of contaminants which can be worse than <em>untreated</em> sewage</strong>.
For this reason, <strong>it is generally advisable to avoid this reach during and immediately
after any significant rains.</strong> In general, the bulk of contamination will pass two days
(48 hours) or less after the CSO/rain-event. (At times of heavy rains, info about whether and
where rivers are affected by CSOs will be posted on the <a href="http://v3.mmsd.com/OverflowAdvisory.aspx" target="blank">MMSD Overflow Advisory</a> website.) At
all other times, this river actually is far cleaner and clearer than many Wisconsin streams!<br>
<br>
Additionally, recreational users of this stretch of river should be aware that it has been
identified as a <strong>&#39;hotspot&#39; for PCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyls)</strong>. Of
particular note in this regard is the &#39;pond&#39; above the Estabrook Dam. (A major
&#39;contributor&#39; to the PCB load was located on Lincoln Creek.) All sediment on this reach
should be considered contaminated. The best information I can find suggests that PCBs primarily
bond with soil and are NOT generally water soluble. This would suggest that as long <strong>as
you stay in your boat, and avoid stirring up any muddy areas, your risk of any PCB contact should
be minimal</strong>.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
While this run may be done as a &#39;dam-to-dam&#39; run (the full reach listed), often
whitewater play-boaters will eliminate the need for a full shuttle and just do a
<strong>&#39;park-and-play&#39; at the two or three main sites</strong> which can offer tame play
even down to fairly low summer flows.<br>
<br>
See &quot;Flow Info&quot; and &quot;Rapids&quot; tabs for much greater detail on this run.
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<em>&quot;Timber Dam&quot;</em> (A.K.A. <em>&quot;Waterworks&quot;</em>), was built in the
early 1900&#39;s by Schlitz Brewery for the purpose of harvesting ice from the river in
winter. At lower flows (under 600 cfs), the river is constricted to about 1/4 it&#39;s
width, flowing only through a gap toward the right side of the timber dam. Playboaters will
find a <em>small</em> surfable wave here (at certain levels, flatspins are possible), but
the bigger &#39;attraction&#39; is the well-defined eddies, strong eddylines, and great
depth. Work on bow stalls and stern squirts, pirouettes and cartwheels, or just practice
peel-outs, ferries, and eddy turns. (I love doing &#39;figure eights&#39;, peeling out of
one eddy, crossing the current, catching the other eddy, paddling up it a bit, then
repeating the process coming back to complete the &#39;8&#39;. It&#39;s great practice for
working on boat-leans and carving turns.)

One-thousand feet (~0.2 mile) downstream <em>The Plague (at Locust)</em> (directly under Locust
Street bridge), a short rocky pitch (actually, almost as much cement rubble as rocks) can provide
additional entertainment, mostly at low summer water levels. (This actually gets MORE interesting
as water drops. Over 1000 cfs, it&#39;s nothing but splishy-splash chop. Down to about 500 or so,
theres&#39; a bit more happening, but still not much. <strong>It comes to its best below 500 cfs,
and even down to 130 cfs!</strong>)<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Canoeists and</span> <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">flatwater</span> <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">recreational
kayakers are advised that <strong>this location actually becomes more dangerous at low
water!</strong> Exercise caution here at levels under 200-300 cfs. A flip or swim may be brutal
due to the shallow rubble in the drop and the run-out. If you have an &#39;out of boat
experience&#39;, quickly assume the <strong>&#39;whitewater swimmers position&#39;</strong> (face
up, feet downstream, floating as near the surface as possible) to encounter shallow rocks with
you feet first, your butt second, and your back (protected by the PFD which you should be
wearing!). <strong>Do not try to stand up or grab your gear until you are in the <em>calmer</em>
water in the pool below the drop. There will be plenty of opportunity (and at less risk to
yourself) to regather your gear in the slower moving water.</strong> Consider portaging
(&#39;beach&#39; your boat on rocks at river-right, carry or drag across to lower pool and put
in), <strong>or take the bypass channel at far river-left (left of the bridge pier)</strong>. It
may be a bit shallow and scrapey at lower flows, but it should be less dangerous!</span><br>
<br>
The site of the former North Avenue Dam is the second area of best entertainment possibilities,
since this is where the most concentrated gradient and (arguably) best play features exist (at
least, at good flows, as detailed in the &quot;Flow info&quot; tab). Unfortunately, some of the
formerly best features here have been greatly diminished by highwater in spring and summer of
2008. This area will get scrapey at low summer flows, especially about midway down this stretch,
where shallow rocky rubble fills the entire riverbed. Under 150-200 cfs, unless you are really
good at picking your line, you can expect to at least hit a few rocks, if not actually grind to a
complete halt!<br>
<br>
Boaters electing to hit any of the play sites (but not do the full run) can either paddle a short
shuttle section or drive between the various Park-and-Play spots, since they all occur where they
can be accessed from convenient parking.<br>
<br>
Since the river is one of the larger watersheds in the area (at 696 square miles), it will
generally retain adequate flow (for novice/intermediate play at Timber Dam/Locust and/or North
Avenue) after other rivers in the area are too low to boat. However, as noted in the &#39;Flow
Info&#39; tab, at levels between 500 and 1000 cfs (give or take), there is much to be said for
enjoying more of a down-river experience, adding the variety of a few other playable spots
available on the &#39;full run&#39;. While there will be regular reminders that you are in the
city (radio towers, three large bridges you&#39;ll pass under, occasional houses, highrises, and
factories visible from the river), the river sits in a decently deep, tree-lined valley, making
it a pleasant escape from (and <em>almost</em> possible to forget) the bustle of the city
surrounding the river.<br>
<br>
Another bonus: Both the Timber Dam / Locust Street location and North Avenue location allow
boating after sunset, by street lights on the bridges as well as the general glow of the city.
(Disclaimer: both locations are in what may be somewhat questionable neighborhoods. I have boated
both locations a good number of times after sunset with no problems or concerns arising, but
won&#39;t swear to that always being the case.)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The North Avenue location will sometimes allow winter paddling, as it can often remain (or flush)
free of ice. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Extreme caution is urged for those who choose
to boat this in winter months. Rip-rap rocks on shore will often be icy, and <strong>the river
just downstream of this stretch will be frozen over</strong>. Mis-steps and miscalculations (or
swims) will be punished (perhaps with your life if you flush under the ice). Make certain you
check the ability to get out (especially if there are ice-shelves from shore) before putting in!
It is strongly recommended (for any winter paddling, when ice is present on shore) to get out at
the pool below &#39;Showboat&#39;, before dropping down the next broken rubble rips, as exit from
the river below is generally much more difficult and potentially dangerous!</span><br>
<br>
If you&#39;re an avid off-road cyclist, bring your mountain bike along. There are challenging
(unofficial) single-track trails each side of the river from North Avenue to Capitol Drive,
complete with a few &#39;stunts&#39; (if that&#39;s your thing). My subjective evaluation (with a
disclaimer that I&#39;m at best a novice off-road biker):
</p>
<blockquote>
river-right (west bank) (north or south): novice,<br>
river-left (east bank) north (upriver): high-intermediate,<br>
river-left (east bank) south (downriver): expert.

<u>Post-flood (June, 2008) addendum</u><br>
<br>
Flooding which occurred spring and early summer 2008 was particularly unkind to whitewater
enthusiasts for this section of river. The &#39;lesser&#39; features in the earlier sections of
the river are largely unchanged. However the North Avenue area, formerly best for whitewater
play, has been greatly diminished.<br>
<br>
The left-most part of the wave at &#39;Shadow&#39; (the sweet &#39;sit-and-spin&#39;
wave-with-pile under the upstream edge of the North Avenue bridge) sometimes loses its pile and
barely allows more than front-surf or back-surf opportunities. That river-left part of the wave
still does serve to give access to the center-river wave, which does have a decent trough and
small pile, and will still allow surfs and spins (for better boaters), though it also is less
retentive than in the past (again, at levels from 400-800 cfs). At levels from 800-1200 cfs, the
wave is a pretty good surf, and seems perhaps a bit grabbier (as in, tripping up your edges) than
it had been before.<br>
<br>
Downstream through the North Avenue area, quarried rock rubble which had been piled on
river-right in a few spots (which created eddies and pushed some of the flow to center-stream)
has been randomly redistributed downstream. As a result, &#39;Typewriter&#39; barely exists
(minor surfs from 500-800 cfs). At levels from 800-1200, the &#39;set up waves&#39; (between
&#39;Typewriter&#39; and &#39;Showboat&#39;) can offer very interesting surfs. &#39;Showboat&#39;
is a small trough-wave which comes-and-goes, which (at it&#39;s best) can be minimally surfed
(and only rarely can be spun on), thus will <i>hardly</i> be found to be worthwhile entertainment
by many whitewater boaters. There is now at least one good-sized rock (in the pool/outflow area
from where &#39;Showboat&#39; used to be) which is large enough and shallow enough (at most
playable flows) to be at risk of serious impact in the event of a flip here. Additionally, from
midway down the North Avenue stretch, until the flanks of the old dam now supporting the
footbridge, the entire streambed is large, angular, rocky rubble.<br>
<br>
As a result, the whole North Avenue area is much less a destination for playboaters than it had
been in the past.

<h2>Rapid Descriptions</h2>
<div><div id='zzq8gn0smegp1rfRiverRapidView44' class='CRiverRapidView-view CRiverRapidView'> <b><a name="rapid102398">Shark's Teeth</a></b> (Class II, Mile -0.1)<br>
<p>
At times, whitewater paddlers may find it worthwhile to carry upstream (from the dam parking lot) about 180 yards to put in just above or just below what some folks call the <em>&quot;Shark&#39;s Teeth&quot;</em>. Tripodal/pyramid structures span the river above the dam to catch large woody debris (to keep it from accumulating on the dam and plugging-up the gates). County crews (with a large crane) periodically remove accumulated wood from these. However, at times when wood is present, <strong>sometimes</strong> there will be one or two gaps through which water pours into the pool (downstream of the debris catchers, upstream of the dam). At flows above 1000cfs, I have seen an easy sweet playable wave form at such a gap, along with good eddy-lines for stalls and squirts.</p>
<p>
Before deciding to put in above the debris catchers, make sure to carefully scout the gaps to be certain of your line, to determine that there are no snags or strainers for you to hang up on, and to be aware of how much current may be sweeping you into this area. Similarly, carefully check which (how many) of the eight lift-gates on the dam are free of debris to allow safe passage.</p>
<br>
<br clear=right>
</div><div id='zzq8gn0smegp1rfRiverRapidView45' class='CRiverRapidView-view CRiverRapidView'> <b><a name="rapid102399">Estabrook Dam - Left Side ("EDL")</a></b> (Class I, Mile -0.0)<br>
<p>
The river-left side of the dam has eight lift-gates which <em><strong>used to</strong></em> be fully-open from late fall through spring, allowing the river to flow freely through. In summer they <em><strong>used to</strong></em> be closed, to have all the water flow over the serpentine fixed-structure dam on the right side of the island here. The past few years there have been problems/controversy regarding the operation of the dam, and the gates have been left wide open year-round.</p>
<p>
At times of increased flow, passing through the open gates, and/or being in the swirls and boils immediately behind the dam can be a bit sketchy (or potentially a bit fun, depending upon your perspective, skill, preparedness, et cetera).</p>
<p>
<strong>Make certain to carefully scout all eight gates before putting in above!</strong> Some wood escapes the <em>&quot;Shark&#39;s Teeth&quot;</em> and does end up caught across the gates of the dam, often blocking-off some number of these gates. Look at the dam/gates from downstream (as well as from upstream) to be certain to be aware of any wood which may block passage through any of them.</p>
<br>
<br clear=right>
</div><div id='zzq8gn0smegp1rfRiverRapidView46' class='CRiverRapidView-view CRiverRapidView'> <b><a name="rapid8180">Estabrook Dam - Right Side ("EDR")</a></b> (Class III, Mile -0.0)<br>
<p>
The river-right side of the dam is a very interesting serpentine stone structure. Unfortunately, this area tends to accumulate tons of wood, often making it impossible to get anywhere near the dam on this side. This is probably a good thing, because the landing zone for most of the serpentine dam is quite shallow. While it has been run (in proper whitewater kayaks), it is best avoided unless you have scouted it ahead at low water (to know where to be and not to be), <strong>and</strong> have also scouted it at <strong>present water level and time</strong>, to know if it is possible to get to your intended route or if it is blocked, and to know how the depth and possible hydraulic may be. In recent years, all the I-beams and stop-boards (which formed the near-island/left-side of this part of the dam) have been removed, leaving a much shorter height to the dam. At times of high flows (above 1500 cfs or so) water will pass over this part of the dam. For anyone considering running that at such times, it would be essential to put in above the &quot;Shark&#39;s Teeth&quot; and then land on the the island to scout the situation below that part of the dam to be aware whether that is runnable or whether a terminal hydraulic may be present, and to be aware of any problems with wood in the drop or downstream on your chosen line.</p>
<p>
The best, most general advice for the vast majority of paddlers is to <strong>stay well away from the lip and base of this dam</strong>.</p>

</div><div id='zzq8gn0smegp1rfRiverRapidView47' class='CRiverRapidView-view CRiverRapidView'> <b><a name="rapid6298">Put-in</a></b> (Class N/A)<br>
<p>
Put-in is most often (and generally recommended) from a &#39;fishermans access&#39; parking lot on river-left at (just downstream of) the Estabrook Park Dam. A very shallow rocky shoals runs from shore toward an island. At flows under 600 cfs there is better passage (better depth of channel) if you ferry across above the shoals to a route near the island before heading downstream. At lower flows, it will be advantageous to put-in from the upstream end of the parking lot (towards the dam) to have decent depth to make the ferry across toward the island and not be grunged-out on the shoals immediately.<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted that this parking area (and the narrow road down to it) is NOT PLOWED in winter, and often remains gated off until sometime in May (or weeks after snow is gone). When this lot is gated, use the listed alternate put-in.</p>
<br>
<br clear=right>
</div><div id='zzq8gn0smegp1rfRiverRapidView48' class='CRiverRapidView-view CRiverRapidView'> <b><a name="rapid102400">Alternate Put-in</a></b> (Class N/A, Mile 0.2)<br>
<p>
At times when the dam parking lot is gated (or otherwise unavailable), park in the next lot to the South down the parkway road. At the southern end of this lot there is now a BierGarten in summer, and there is an overlook (and stairs down to river level) to view the Estabrook Park Ledge. Boat access to the river from these stairs would be very awkward due to vertical stone walled shore. So, while you may wish to park in the south end of the lot (near the beer garden, kid&#39;s playground, and ball diamond) to walk down and scout the drop, it will be far more convenient to access the river if you <strong>park at the NorthWest end of the lot</strong>. Carry your boat(s) back on a paved path toward the tree line, bear right onto the paved bike path, crossing a tresltle over a ravine, then look to the left for a set of stone steps to head down to the riverbank. There should be a fine clearing on shore with low banks to put-in, and you&#39;ll have a short paddle (with plenty of time to get to river-right shore to scout the ledge if you did not previously do so from the south end of the parking lot).</p>

<p>
The river here is quite wide and drops across a short ledge. <b>Paddlers in canoes, recreational kayaks or sea kayaks are likely to go ashore (river-right) to portage around this drop.</b> Various options are available for the more skilled or adventurous (in appropriate craft) to run the drop. A sloping chute lies well to river-left, and may be the &#39;line of choice&#39; for more timid paddlers. You are likely to &#39;grunge out&#39; a bit in the chute or encounter shallow rock in the pool below the chute. I generally prefer a route about 1/3 off the river-right bank. A short upper ledge forms a funky upper wave/hole (which can be played at flows around 400-800 cfs). A line which &#39;lips&#39; the right edge of that wave/hole, and angles hard toward center stream, will take the paddler off a point on the ledge which juts furthest downstream, allowing a pretty smooth clean &#39;boof&#39; into the mush-pile below. Again, depending upon water level, almost anywhere across the breadth of this drop will work. However, as flows rise above 1000 cfs or so, the reversal at the base of the drop becomes more problematic. At such flows, stay in the left half of the drop to avoid the hydraulic which forms across the right half.</p>
<p>
It has always been frustrating that, across the whole width of this ledge, there is almost not a spot which offers very much meaningful play. Most of the width across the ledge has such a uniform boil-line that any attempts to play will likely pull you in sideways and hold your boat, leaving you struggle to keep from being &#39;window-shaded&#39; (leading me to call it &#39;park-and-flail&#39; boating). Potentially the best play is well to river-left (&#39;surfers-right&#39;), where the shallow tongue sheets water downstream, and there is a narrow playable hole between that tongue and shore. This has been best at flows from 400-1100 cfs or so.<br/>
<br/>
The following video (courtesy KBraband, via YouTube) shows the put-in and runs of this ledge.<br/>
<br/>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/9WW1gxFzY0o?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
At levels somewhere above 3000-4000 cfs, the whole ledge is &#39;swalowed up&#39; by high water in the &#39;pool&#39; below, and a river-wide assortment of green (brown) waves and holes (really more wave-like, but with smooth breaking pile) start to appear. At some of these elevated levels, shoreline eddies actually allow paddling upstream far enough to regain the waves for repeat play. Be well advised that while the river is on the rise into these levels, likelihood of CSO (Combined Sewer Overflow) is high, and (even absent a CSO) water quality is likely to be nasty with all the contaminants associated with urban runoff. While the copious volume of flow means the contaminants will be diluted, you will have to decide your comfort level for exposure to the possible risks. A day or two after the rain event, the worst of such contaminants are likely to have passed.</p>

<p>
At 0.75 miles from your put-in, as the river-right bank clears (becoming an open grassy slope) and as you see the lightposts in the U-Park (parking lot) high up the bank, a boulderbed shoals (class I riffles and rips) leads around a sweeping right-hand bend. At the end of this roughly 1/4 mile stretch, as soon as trees again populate the river-right bank, a minor double-ledge (bedrock intrusion) exists on the <strong>right half</strong> of the river. At flows in the 400-1000 range, some very nice beginner/intermediate play is possible here. Front surfs, side surfs, and flatspins may be practiced to your heart&#39;s content. Better playboaters may also manage some backsurfs and blasting. A sweet attainment move is possible also, coming off the lower (main) wave to &#39;surfers right&#39; (toward center-river), ferrying across a bit of current, paddling up a break (slackwater) to another minor diagonal ledge/wave, surfing it to the upstream/left (toward river-right), and paddling up slackwater to regain an upper wave.</p>
<p>
At higher flows (above 1000, to 2000-3000 cfs) this location develops some very nice waves (often with sweet soft foam-pile). Surfing will be marvelous, but mostly &#39;catch-on-the-fly&#39;. It may be possible to regain the bottom wave/hole by paddling tight to river-right banks, but a fallen tree confounds that path a bit.</p>
<p>
Since Timber Dam and Locust are generally pretty lame when flows are adequate to have best play at EPL/UPL/N.Ave., some boaters may wish to maximize play and cut out the nearly 2.5 miles of mostly uninteresting paddle between here and North Avenue by just doing a short shuttle to run Estabrook Park Ledge and the U-Park Ledge. This might be done on its own, or then driving down to have whatever fun one can at North Avenue.</p>

<p>
An old timber dam (used by the breweries to harvest ice from the river in the days before modern refrigeration) blocks nearly three-fourths of the river (at flows under 800 cfs). A small smooth wave sometimes forms in the &#39;gap&#39;, generally being better the lower the flow goes (all the way down to minimal summer flows!). Very well-defined eddy-lines are present in the deep pool below the flanks of the timber dam. This spot can offer great opportunities for bow stalls and stern squirts, as well as &#39;old-school&#39; pirouettes. Beginners may practice river-running skills such as peel-outs, eddy turns and ferrying.<br/>
<br/>
At levels above 800 cfs, water flows over the entire width of the dam/river, and there is generally no whitewater interest here as a result.<br/>
<br/>
Note: this site may be done as a &#39;park-and-play&#39;. Driving on Humboldt Boulevard until just a bit north of Locust Street, turn East on E.Chambers Street. Proceed to park on the street at the end of the public parking on this dead end. Carry down the pavement (outside of the pumping station), over or around a chain strung between posts, and straight down the grassy open area to the river.</p>
<p>
Update Spring, 2013: Time is unkind to us here. High water (and ice-out) continue to knock down more of the old timbers from the dam. As a result, the dynamics and play potential of this spot are reduced, since water is not funneled as narrowly as before, and the eddy lines are not as well-defined.</p>

Directly under the Locust Street bridge, the main channel (right of the bridge pier) contains rocky rubble (including cement and rebar) which creates a short rocky pitch.<br/>
At levels somewhere above 500 cfs most of the debris is covered, and there is little more than splishy-splash rips (and perhaps a couple unsurfable waves) -- barely even a rated rapids!<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">At lower summer levels this area actually becomes more interesting</span> (I.E., potentially more treacherous to beginners or non-whitewater paddlers, potentially more playable for whitewater paddlers). At these lower flows, piles of rubble create more constricted flow. <b>Canoeists may be best advised to <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">kneel into the bottom of the canoe</span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">(get your weight off the seats, lower the center-of-gravity, and increase your stability; do NOT raise your arms and paddle high overhead! Keep paddling!) or </span>consider portaging (though any wet rocks on or near shore will be quite slick! Watch your footing!)</b>.<br/>
<br/>
Boaters who flip or swim are warned that <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">there is a great deal of shallow coarse cement rubble in the main outflow in the pool below the main pitch. </span><b><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">DO NOT ATTEMPT TO STAND while in the swift current!!!</span></b> Assume the &#39;swimmer&#39;s position&#39;, floating as near the surface as possible, face up, feet downstream. You WILL encounter rocks and cement with your shoes, your butt, and your (PFD protected) back. Wait until you are downstream in the calmer water in the pool before you even think about trying to find bottom, stand up, and collect your boat and gear. Attempting to stand (or swim face forward, face down) in swift moving water is VERY likely to result in bruised and scraped up shins!<br/>
<br/>
There is a much smaller channel to the left of the bridge pier which has far less rubble and debris in the flow. At the low flows (120-250 cfs) at which the main channel is most treacherous for beginners and non-whitewater paddlers, this less obvious channel is unlikely to be a viable alternative to the main channel. (Though at lowest summer flows, shallow sandbars in the pool below may &#39;ground out&#39; your boat.) At flows in the 120-500 cfs range, there <em>may</em> form a playable wave/hole here, which I would call <em><b>Garbage Falls</b></em>. This is not nearly so much a name for the feature as it is a warning about what happens here. All manner of debris is (rarely, but . . .) randomly dumped into the river from the bridge overhead -- garbage bags, shopping carts, bicycles, defunct electronics (TVs, radios), et cetera. So . . . remember . . . &quot;Garbage Falls&quot; (from overhead). Pedestrians on the bridge overhead may consider you a fun target for tossing trash, knowing they can be long gone before you could catch them.</p>

<p>As you approach the North Avenue Bridge, you encounter the start of 300+ yards of swift water and waves, leading to the remnants of the North Avenue dam, now spanned by a pedestrian bridge.<br/>
<br/>
A 'fault' in the paver-block bottom creates a sweet surfable/spinnable wave, which lies in the shadow of the North Avenue bridge (hence the name of the wave). Whitewater kayakers ('play boaters') will find entertainment here at levels from about 300 to 1000 cfs. Somewhere above that level, while the wave/hole may still exist, it will be difficult to regain as the eddy will more-and-more disappear.<br/><br/>NOTE: High water levels spring and summer of 2008 have apparently caused changes to this feature. While it used to 'always' have a sweet pocket and 'pile', it now often is only a green (brown) wave. Particularly, the river-left-most pocket-wave, at 500-600 cfs, was merely a front-surfable wave, mostly worthwhile to surf across for repeat play on the center-river wave-with-pile, which still allowed flatspins, front-, and back-surfs.</p><br>

<p>A sweet wave/hole forms at flows between 400 and 1000 cfs. Experienced whitewater playboaters will be able to get surfs and flatspins. A decent shoreline slackwater/eddy on river-right allows repeat play.<br/>
<br/>NOTE: High water levels spring and summer of 2008 have caused changes to this feature. Originally, this was a 'diagonal wave' which looked like it would 'typewriter' you off to river-left. However, that diagonal nature no longer exists, and now (when it is 'in') it tends to be just a short wave, or small breaking wave (hole) pretty much in center-river.</p><br>

<p>
A slip in the paver-block &#39;bedrock&#39;&nbsp; center-river&nbsp;causes a series of surfable waves. Rocks have shifted (in flooding June of 2008), and now at least one boater has had a &#39;close encounter of the worst kind&#39; with a rock in the main flow just downstream of the wave here. (Fortunately, he &#39;tagged&#39; it with his back and shoulder, not his helmet/head.) There are many shallow rocks to the sides (in the eddies), as well as further downstream closer to the next very rocky pitch.<br/>
<br/>
On the river-left shore there are a number of areas of &#39;gabions&#39; (think chain link fence baskets filled with rocks) and other wire-mesh which have failed. These are only in the shoreline eddy areas, thus should not cause problems of snagging boaters unless you are out of your boat, swimming toward the left shore. (HINT:&nbsp;Swim to the right shore!)<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: High water levels spring and summer of 2008 caused changes to this feature. At 550-800 cfs, it is a barely noticeable trough, and appears and disappears (surges). It may be possible to catch a surf for a bit, but it will not amuse for very long. The &#39;lead-in&#39; waves (when they are present) are being a better surf than the (former) main wave here.</p>

Canoeists and novice swiftwater paddlers are likely to find this stretch of splishy-splash water rather exciting. Whitewater boaters may find a bit of minor play, catching a mid-river eddy (behind a few early rocks) and dropping to one side or the other to play a wave or two which forms here at certain levels.<br/>
<br/>
At levels over 400 cfs or so, all rocks should be adequately covered to allow passage most anywhere. As levels drop, however, boats are likely to grunge-out on shallow rock. Anyone upside-down (in a kayak) or out of their boat will likely be bruised and battered on the large rock rubble which lies under water, lining the entire riverbed in this stretch. If you are in the river (out of your boat) here, you will need to be very careful getting ashore. Footing will be very trecherous on the quarried rock in the river and on shore. In the river, float on you back if you can (if it is deep enough), or crawl (on hands and feet/knees) so you don&#39;t slip and fall and bash a knee, shins, or your wrists/hands/elbows! Be very aware of the dangers of foot entrapment in the large quarried rock!</p>

<i>Riverboat Road Take-out</i></div><div>Photo by Rob Smage taken 03/19/12</div></div> <br style='clear:both'>
</div>
</div> 
<p>
There are numerous options for your take-out.</p>
<p>
1) <strong>Take out</strong> halfway between North Avenue and the footbridge (spanning the flanks of the old dam) <strong>before you float down a shallow rubble shoals and the last half of this stretch</strong>, which is flanked by quarry-rock shores. Footing to exit the river is easy if you take out from this pool and carry up to your vehicle. (NOTE:&nbsp;the sediment containment paver-blocks which line the riverbanks are likely to be very slippery, but at least they provide smooth, stable walking surface.) Serious whitewater playboaters&nbsp;may find it easiest (and most advantageous) to use this optionfor repeat-play of this stretch, since there is generally no additional &#39;play&#39; down the&nbsp;remaining half of this stretch, and it just doubles the walk back up.</p>
<p>
2) If you proceed down the final rocky pitch, you may attempt to find an eddy somewhere&nbsp;<strong>prior to passing under&nbsp;the footbridge</strong>. This will require that you exit your boat&nbsp;from a somewhat precarious eddy, carefully step out onto quarry rock (which is likely to be VERY SLIPPERY anyplace which is wet!), and carry your boat across very irregular quarry-rock, some of which is unstable, and may shift under your weight. Falling here would be potentially very painful, if not injurious, so <strong>be extremely careful about your footing if you choose this option</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
3) Float beyond the pedestrian footbridge which now spans the shoulders of the former dam. <strong>NOTE, however, that when the river runs high (above 1000 cfs) there will be VERY&nbsp;DYNAMIC swirls and boils (even small whirlpools which form randomly!) as the fast water meets the flat water below the dam. Above 2000-3000 cfs, this area gets downright wicked looking! <em>At all flows above 1000 cfs, I strongly recommend walking to the center of the pedestrian bridge before running this stretch, to make sure you are prepared for what awaits you here!</em></strong></p>
<p>
Two more options exist down here.</p>
<p>
3A) After passing under the pedestrian bridge, you can IMMEDIATELY head to the right bank, take out very near the dam, and hike up a very steep, rocky embankment. Unfortunately, rocks have shifted in recent years, and this is much less convenient a climb.</p>
<p>
3B) The final option is perhaps best all around, at least for all flows UNDER 1000 cfs or so. Paddle a short way downstream to an improved landing with huge quarry-rock steps (shown in the photo). A gravelled trail leads up to Riverboat Road just past a former single-family home (now being converted to offices for a river-related non-profit).<input id="mac_address" type="hidden" value=""/></p>

As mentioned in the full write-up, at times of heavy rains, this section of river is VERY LIKELY to<br/>
suffer from Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO). It is recommended that you check the MMSD website ******<br/>
http://www.mmsd.com/v2/news/overflow_advisory.cfm ****** for conditions before running this reach<br/>
when there have been heavy rains, then decide for yourself if you wish to risk boating in the<br/>
(diluted) sewage affecting this river. Areas affected should generally be clear (of the bulk of<br/>
that specific contamination) a couple days after the CSO ends. </div>
