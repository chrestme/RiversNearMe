<h2>River Description</h2>
<p>
<strong>GENERAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
Because State Hwy 140 goes essentially continuously along the bank of the Merced, one can
take-out and put-in almost anywhere that the berry bushes and poison oak allow. This means that,
flow levels allowing, one can choose as easy or hard, and long or short, a day as one wants, from
scary expert stuff higher up to a great novice run in the miles above Briceburg and below. The
Gauge Hole just upstream from the Slate Creek Bridge (approx. 3.5 miles above Briceburg, 10+
miles below Red Bud, actually Feliciano Creek on the topo maps) is a great park-and-play spot at
any flow above about 600 cfs or so on the Briceburg gauge.<br>
<br>
The Main/Central Fork of the Merced River is one of the originally designated federal Wild and
Scenic Rivers. Curiously enough in light of this, the majority of the river segment in this reach
has essentially 100% man-made banks on both sides. The river-left bank is defined by Hwy 140;
river-right is the remains of the old Yosemite Railroad bed. This &quot;man-made bank&quot; is
primarily manifested by a great amount of artificial (boulder and cement slurry)stabilization on
the highway bank by CalTrans, and some &quot;rerouting&quot; of the river&#39;s course, most
notably in the section above the Foresta Bridge (Red Bud). Surprisingly and thankfully, the road
is not particularly visible from the river level, and is not as intrusive as it could be. There
is still a plentiful supply of drive-by spectators. The railroad bed is eroding away and not a
big visual issue at all any more.<br>
<br>
The Merced is steepest and most difficult on its upstream end, leading up into Yosemite National
Park where paddling is banned/illegal except for a short flat segment in the midde of Yosemite
Valley, per the Park Superintendent&#39;s decree; ask and I&#39;ll answer questions honestly and
as best I can based on more experience than I should have, but this is outside the boundries of
this reach. As one goes downstream from Parkline and El Portal, the difficulty decreases very
gradually in general. Until one gets below Briceburg (14 miles downstream from Red Bud), the
Merced drops very steadily without the &quot;pool and drop&quot; features of many other Sierra
rivers.<br>
<br>
In the upper portions, especially at moderate to higher flows, the rapids can be very long and
close together, making sections where one can swim for literally a mile or more through multiple
rapids; I have first hand knowledge of this, having learned to kayak on this river. This can be
true lower down as well, as the banks can be full of vegetation &quot;strainers&quot; for
extended lengths even in the easier sections downstream. I have spoken with more than a few
paddlers who have stated that the Merced could be referred to as &quot;Class 3/4 with Class 5/6
consequences&quot; because of it&#39;s continuous nature in the upper parts.<br>
<br>
Other nuisances and hazards can include: rattlesnakes, lots of poison oak throughout, floating
snag trees - both natural and man-caused by locals and emergency winter road clearing work.<br>
<br>
<strong>YOSEMITE PARK BOUNDARY TO THE HWY 140 BRIDGE</strong><br>
Not very commonly run, especially after it got widened and changed significantly in January 1997.
From Parkline to the Hwy 140 Bridge, it is continuous Class 4/5 with very few short breaks and
only at lower flows. This is very boulder-y and wide.<br>
<br>
<strong>HWY 140 BRIDGE IN EL PORTAL TO THE FORESTA BRIDGE</strong><br>
Put in at the small parking spots on the down-canyon end of the bridge, better on the upstream
(east/upcanyon lane) side of the bridge. There is room for 3 cars if all think/plan accordingly
when parking on this side. Take-out at the Foresta Bridge/Red Bud site.<br>
<br>
From the Hwy 140 Bridge in El Portal down past the NPS Admin, Maint, and sewer plant to the
Foresta Bridge is about the farthest upstream segment that is commonly paddled. This run is
almost instantly and continuously challenging with almost no room for a &quot;warm up,&quot; and
at most flows, few breaks or rest spots. Approx. 10 years ago a group of raft guides put in just
above this run at relatively high flow and with only an hour or so of daylight left. Their raft
flipped almost immediately, and the swimmers were swept a mile or more downstream through this
section. One died.<br>
<br>
This segment is best at flows from 1000 cfs to 4000 cfs or so; at some point in that range, it
becomes essentially 3 or 4 long and continuous Class 4 rapids, with only a couple of very short
breaks that can be missed as you go by. It doesn&#39;t let up until you get down close to Hwy 140
and the Sewer Plant. Above 5000 cfs, this can become one continuous and unforgiving Class 5 rapid
more than a mile long.<br>
<br>
At lower levels - approx. 350 cfs on the Pohono gauge - this section requires much maneuvering to
avoid rocks, and two short portages are recommended highly to avoid rocky traps. The first is at
a rapid called Boomer at the upstream end of the NPS Gravel Pit area and past the trailer village
and research station on the left. The river will obviously open out on the left bank here as it
sweeps around a left turn. The second is the final rocky pour-through just above the sewer plant
and easily scouted from the road on either side.<br>
<br>
At higher flows than above, Boomer goes best staying far left (there is a very large hole and
small brush/rock island right). It can be difficult to see the actual Boomer Rock from upstream
due to the water piling around it. Boomer can be easily road scouted from the Foresta Road on the
side opposite Hwy 140. It is just downstream from Rancheria Road, the relatively new NPS housing
area, and the old circular concrete sewer plant now overgrown with weeds. The Sewer Plant pour
through becomes relatively inconsequential aside from the small tree/brush in the middle. It can
be easily/best road-scouted from the Hwy 140 side.<br>
<br>
One other feature towards the bottom of this run deserves a mention and possibly a warning. At
the bottom of the straight run below Boomer is a small island on river right with a tight passage
between island and back. The major rapid-forming feature is a complex of several very large round
boulders at the downstream end of the channel. It was great fun to run through and over at higher
flows - 3000+ - the year it formed, 1997. It has been unrunnable since, due to trees which fell
down and blocked it. Last year at the end of the paddling season, a couple of civic-minded locals
removed them in the name of &quot;Preventative SAR (Search and Rescue). Having looked at the
trap/pin potential in these boulders, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll ever run that way again.<br>
<br>
<strong>FORESTA BRIDGE,AKA RED BUD, TO THE INDIAN FLAT PICNIC AREA.</strong><br>
This is a relatively short section, with long, continuous Class 3 and 3+ sections, and at least
two Class 4 rapids, Nightmare Island and Chipped Tooth. Both Class 4s are across Hwy 140 from an
obvious CalTrans gravel pit, at the end of a 1/2+ mile straight and long Class 3 beginning just
below the put-in. Post &#39;97 flood, Nightmare Island changed, and the left side route may only
be 3+/4-. The right side is a constricted channel with a couple of very rocky drops and
reversals; there is some real possibility of hitting hidden rocks at most levels. At higher
flows, above 4000 cfs or so, Nightmare runs into Chipped Tooth and they can essentially become
one rapid. <em>At these higher flows, the boulder sieve that forms Chipped Tooth should be a
serious consideration is swimming is possible anywhere in these two rapids</em><br>
<br>
Both Nightmare Island and Chipped Tooth can be scouted from Hwy 140; park in the Gravel Pit
turnout and watch out for maniacs in cars when crossing the street. If considering the right side
of Nightmare Island (worth doing if you are justifiably confident of your abilities at this
difficulty level), scout if from the island or from the Foresta Road across the river from Hwy
140.<br>
<br>
The right side of Chipped Tooth seems moderately easier than the right [highly subjective, I
admit]; at low-moderate flows, it can be eddy-hopped down small right bank eddys up to the steep
boulder pour-throughs; at moderate-higher flows, this route still works to paddle through if you
can&#39;t or don&#39;t hit the narrow bank eddys. The left side goes as well at most flows, but
the sudden large left-right &quot;reversals&quot; - waves, not holes - towards the bottom can be
hard to manage.<br>
<br>
<em>BEWARE - the largest drop and the &quot;Chipped Tooth&quot; is formed by a group of large
boulders going across the river bed, with very real sieve/trap potential if one were out of the
boat or in a bad position at most flows.</em><br>
<br>
In 1999(?) a local paddler and friend in a relatively small boat missed the boof over the middle;
he penciled, and found himself pinned flat, still in his boat, at the bottom of the river. He
escaped barely, and spent the next day and a half retrieving his boat via high line and
hook-and-pole.<br>
<br>
Downstream another mile or more, watch for a power transformer station river left and across the
road. Beyond this, and just where the river left bank joins the road again, is an old red wooden
house on river right. This is the site of Red House Hole, a good play spot at most flows. Another
1/3 mile brings you to Indian Flat Picnic Area, a former camping spot now paved, outhoused, and
developed by the USFS and BLM as a commercial raft put-in point. By early afternoon mid-season,
it is clear of the rafters.<br>
<br>
<strong>INDIAN FLAT PICNIC AREA TO SAVAGE&#39;S TRADING POST AND THE CONFLUENCE OF THE SOUTH FORK
MERCED</strong><br>
Except for the times of day when in peak use by commercial raft companys as a put in, this can be
a good starting point. Parking is limited, as is driving and turning space in general, so please
be considerate of the big guys. Their options are much less limited than for the rest of us, and
kayakers expecially can put in almost anywhere there is enough shoulder to park on. A short
distance downstream is the first real, and hardest, rapid on this segment.<br>
<br>
Pre &#39;97 flood, Hotel Hole was one of the Merced&#39;s legendary too-much-fun spots. My
contention is that it really doesn&#39;t exist any more, at least in anything resembling the
thing I did vertical 360-degree loops in open breathable air inside it on a boogie-board. It now
is a long steep narrow &quot;sluice&quot; entered after a quick left-right turn, having been
re-engineered on river left by CalTrans in spring of &#39;97. There are kayak eddys on the sides
until we see high flow levels, and a very fine large angled wave towards the bottom on the right.
This wave is responsible for some most excellent aerial action for all sizes of craft at
moderate/high flows, with good spectator and recovery pools just below.<br>
<br>
The next several miles include many entertaining Class 3 (give or take) rapids of varying
lengths, including things like the Can Opener and the Percolater. Recovery pools or flat sections
get more common as one progresses downstream. Several good play spots can be found along the way,
as well. Another convenient landmark with a surprising amount of parking is at Savage&#39;s
Trading Post. This is spotted easily by the portable outhouse trailer, and a good supply of
parked cars left by hikers enjoying the wildflowers on the Hite&#39;s Cove hiking trail leading
up behind Savage&#39;s. If full, there is parking and easy river access just downstream of
Savage&#39;s and the S.Fork Bridge.<br>
<br>
<strong>SOUTH FORK MERCED TO MILLER&#39;S LANDING (the old Suspension Bridge, destroyed by flood
water in Jan. 1997).</strong><br>
THIS IS THE LOW WATER EARLY/LATE SEASON RUN! It can be run without portage or too much rock abuse
when the Briceburg Flow Gauge reads 330 cfs or higher. I usually paddle past Miller&#39;s Landing
at low water, and take out a few rapids downstream or go to Gauge Hole; see &quot;Miller&#39;s to
Briceburg.&quot; This section has a bit of flat paddling at low-moderate flows, several very good
Class 3 sections, Ned&#39;s Gulch - the &quot;standard&quot; for Class 4 difficulty in these
parts according to AWA&#39;s &quot;example&quot; list, and several good play spots.<br>
<br>
At the end of the first long straight rapid, the river rejoins the road and turns to the right.
At most flows, there is a long wave train just beyond the bend with good large eddys river right
and downstream. These waves can be some of the best wave surfing on the Merced; they need approx.
1000 cfs to start to form up and are good for several thousand cfs beyond that. 1/4 mile
downstream on river left is a large beach used by locals for picnic/partying, nude sunbathing,
etc. It is relatively hidden from the highway, but easy to spot as it is a steel guardrail on the
river side of a large sweeping turn (to the right going uphill), marked as &quot;30 mile an
hour&quot; turn and with signs on both sides of the road warning about parking facing opposing
traffic.<br>
<br>
WARNING! Ferguson Rockslide<br>
David Greenwood&mdash;BLM River Ranger reports:<br>
In April of 2006, a large-scale rock slide completely buried a few hundred yards of HW 140. Talus
from the slide protrudes more than ten feet into the river at Balls to the Wall Rapid (about 1
mile downstream from the South Fork). The main channel is significantly constricted and many new
boulders now choke the entrance to the old Balls Rapid. As flows increase there is potential for
a near-river-wide hole. Likewise, as flows increase, a sneak channel opens up on the far right.
Take a look at it from the road while setting your shuttle, but do not stop anywhere along the HW
140 detour, as this is a one&mdash;lane traffic control area. Scout the rapid at river level from
the right bank. Stay away from river left; most of the ugly sharp junk is on that side and stray
rocks are still coming down.<br>
<br>
The Sierra National Forest has established a monitoring plan and color coded alert system. Level
Green is all go. Yellow is increased caution. Level Orange may close the river to boating. Red
closes the river and the highway! Check the current conditions before leaving home at <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/sierra/conditions/ferguson.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/sierra/condi...ferguson.shtml</a>

Caltrans is studying several altenate methods of rebuilding the route back to a high
standard.&nbsp; At present, buses, trucks or any vehicle over 28 feet long cannot use the detour
and must enter Yosemite via Highways 120 or 41.&nbsp;&nbsp; Study plans will be posted when we
find them. (Feb. 2008)<br>

<br>
A few rapids and a half mile or so brings us to Balls to the Wall, a Class 3+/4- rapid. Balls has
several large rocks in the middle of the river bed, then bends right, drops 6-8 ft (?) through a
rocky section of 30-50 ft or so, and then turns back left sharply along a short cliff/rock
section. It is somewhat tricky to stay off of the wall at the bottom; post &#39;97 flood, the
anatomical dragging that helped name the rapid in the upper turn/drop was lessened dramatically.
There is a small eddy river right just before the wall turns back to the left that can be caught;
surfing out of this and then turning downstream is one means of avoiding the wall. Balls to the
Wall may be a bit easier than it used to be, but BE FOREWARNED!<br>
<br>
<em>WARNING - THERE ARE A COUPLE OF VERY NASTY ROCKS HIDDEN IN THE WAVE TRAIN ALONG THE WALL AT
LOW/MODERATE FLOWS.</em> There have been a lot of people including myself that have flipped and
swam or rolled or just hung amd missed. There have also been a couple of the worst kayak wrecks
that have ever made me sick to my stomach to watch; luckily, no permanent injuries, but a fair
amount of blood and bruises, broken paddles, etc. Please believe - you do not want to see
anyone&#39;s boat upside down and then levitate straight up several feet for no apparent
wave/reason.<br>
<br>
At the downstream end of Balls to the Wall are bank eddys on both sides that can be used to catch
another (actually a couple, if you look close) of large surfing waves that are as good as any on
any river at the right flows. The right flows seem to be around 1500 - 5000+ cfs.<br>
<br>
The river channel changes noticeably at this point and for the next mile or so, becoming a
tighter channel with folded granitic gneiss bedrock walls on both banks. Where it opens out very
noticeably to the right with an occupied house and working mine, you have come to Ned&#39;s
Gulch, the &quot;standard/example&quot; for a Class Four (at around 4000 cfs) rapid. There is a
large eddy to the right, and it is easy to scout or portage on the right along the river.<br>
<br>
Ned&#39;s Gulch is a long set of turmultous waves/holes and a couple of drops towards the bottom,
ending in a large wave train and a good run-out. The rapid bends around in a left hand turn, and
can push quite hard to the right; staying off the right hand wall or out of the
&quot;challenging&quot; eddys on that side can be quite a chore but needs to be done for almost
all but the most skilled. Many lines are possible, some better than others depending upon the
flow level and skill of the paddler. The general best idea/line seems to be to start left of
center, go right of center around the largest rock sticking up in the middle about 2/3 of the way
down (you get pushed that way anyway), and finish by paddling as far to the left as possible
while not loosing your bow angle downstream. The game is to stay off the right hand wall at the
bottom - doesn&#39;t seem to hurt anyone, but makes it hard to stay upright at the final drop
into the wave train.<br>
<br>
<em>A Caution at low flows, below 600-700 cfs, maybe higher -</em> The bottom drop on the right
side has several hidden rocks at the bottom of it. They can be pitoned most uncomfortably, and
otherwise be in the way. It is really important to work back to the left after rounding the large
rock towards the bottom at these lower flows. If all else fails, boof with all you got.<br>
<br>
Below Ned&#39;s, there is nothing harder than Class 3 until well below Briceburg. Approx. 1/4
mile below Ned&#39;s, at the end of a gentle right turn, a series of very sharp rocks (rafts have
been Hindenberged here)with an island river right just upstream at low/moderate flows. The island
goes to either side, the easier run is to the right. To the left can take some quick maneuvering,
and work to avoid the left wall at the bottom. Doesn&#39;t look like much, but can sneak up and
slash you. At higher flows, the largest rocks get buried inside some large green-water waves;
wave crashing can bite back here.<br>
<br>
Beyond this rapid, there are a few more class 2+/3- rapids, and some relatively flat spots.
Approx. 3/4 mile below Ned&#39;s, you&#39;ll see in the distance on river right an old miners
camp and cement plant marking Miller&#39;s Landing. The rapid here is straight with a few
significant holes at larger flows, but in general a fun series of haystacks and called the
&quot;Rodeo Rapid&quot; by some locals. At the end is a beach and river access with a good amount
of parking. This is a good take-out, or one can continue down. Note that there are owners of
Miller&#39;s Landing occasionally in residence, using a wire rope bridge with hanging pull-car to
cross the river. They seem generally unfriendly, and have a local reputation for persecuting
trespassers - it is posted no trespassing. The other distinctive feature at this point (not that
you can miss the large white 2-3 story buildings) is the remnants of a wooden one-lane suspension
bridge that was the primary land-mark for this site until destroyed in Jan. of 1997.<br>
<br>
<strong>MILLER&#39;S LANDING TO BRICEBURG</strong><br>
This is what passes for the local &quot;beginner/learning&quot; run; for really inexperienced
parties or those without at least one strong rescuer/paddler, it might be worth starting further
down, especially at moderate to high flows. Nothing harder than 2+/3- until it gets high, but
long swims, a lack of bank eddys, and a fair amount of brush in the water on both sides still can
be had.<br>
<br>
The put-in/tale-out spot at Miller&#39;s Landing is an obvious large rocky beach with good trail
and lots of parking extneding down the road. It is used as a take out for many coming from
farther upstream, such as from Indian Flat or Red Bud.<br>
<br>
Gauge Hole, below the Sweetwater Creek Bridge and just above the Slate Creek Bridge, is a worthy
destination play spot at flows above 1500 cfs. At over 8000 cfs, Gauge becomes a glassy wave with
a 10-15 foot glassy wave front; it always has a good access eddy river right, and is used as a
common take-out by local paddlers and those wanting to finish with a good play session. Gauge
Hole is actually a combination wave-hole, formed by two flat fronted and topped rocks with a
space between them just big enough to pass a kayak bow, and forming a seam and sub-surface
current going out the back of the pile. At even moderate flows, this is a large steep
&quot;keeper&quot; wave/hole that can hold side-surfing kayakers long after they are tired and
want out. At moderate to high flows, full sized rafts can be surfed here. The easiest way out if
all else fails is to flip upside down, and if not washed out quickly, reach carefully
(shoulders?) down/around with your paddle - the under-current will always sweep you out the
back.<br>
<br>
There is a fairly large amount of parking here on both sides of the road. Putting in and taking
out kayaks directly at the hole can be done if one looks close at the rocky ramps leading down
from the road. An easier takout - trees/brush not withstanding - is to take out just downstream
directly at the &quot;Slate Creek&quot; bridge (actually Feliciano Creek on the topo maps), and
going up to the road either through the grapes on the left before the bridge, or by going under
the bridge on your right and then up to the road. Rattlesnakes have been seen under bridge, along
with many other areas of the Merced from here down. This is also a &quot;decent&quot; put-in for
those on their first kayak run in moving water, or those looking for Class 1-2 only. It can still
be fast and very brushy along the edges at moderate to high flows, so think/plan accordingly.<br>
<br>
Downstream take-out on this segment is the BLM parking lot at Briceburg. When Bear creek is
running on warm days, the inflow has a nice warm pool, a bit tight, but good for roll
training/practice for one kayak.<br>
<br>
<strong>BRICEBURG TO RAILROAD FLAT, the end of road access from upstream</strong><br>
This section is very different from the Merced River upstream of this point. It still has
continuous road access, but on a dirt road along the river right side. The banks are steeper with
more short rocky faces, the channel is narrower, and the rapids more pool-and-drop style than the
long continuous boulder fields upstream. It stays more enjoyably paddle-able at the lowest
flows.<br>
<br>
The first mile and a half or so are relatively flat, with only a couple of constrictions and/or
turns forming easy (class 2+/-?) rapids. Around this point, you can see some large metal plates
in the right(road) bank; on the road, there may be some large metal plates visible depending upon
how much dirt is around. This is the siphon/pump station that provides the town of Mariposa with
its municipal water supply, and also the site and reason for the flow gauge &quot;below
Briceburg.&quot; There is a good beach here at low/moderate flows.<br>
<br>
Below this point, the river starts to accelerate until it reaches a couple of class 3 rapids
close to McCabe Flat. If not careful, the first of two class 4 rapids, &quot;Split Rock&quot;,
can sneak up on the unwary. At low/moderate flows, this shouldn&#39;t be a problem as the route
is pretty much straight down the middle in the tongue. At moderate/higher flows, some scary holes
can form, and this rapid becomes essentially one with the next rapid, a somewhat harder (at most
flows) rapid called &quot;Corner Pocket&quot; for very good reason.<br>
<br>
<em>Warning - at moderate to high flows, Split Rock and Corner Pocket can run together into one
large and scary complex rapid. Scouting thouroughly before deciding to run this is strongly
recommended, given the rocky nature of the rapids and the eddy trap at the bottom.</em><br>
<br>
Corner Pocket can be scouted and portaged at the campground on river right, McCabe Flat. It is a
rocky angular pore-over several feet tall, at the bottom of a rocky lead-in. If one enters or
gets pushed too far to the left, you end up in the Corner Pocket at the bottom, river left. The
first time I saw this feature, I watched six kayaks follow into this like lemmings. All six ended
up swimming out, with the boats tumbling in the pocket for later retrieval. The current below the
pore-over splits, and the left flow goes up against a flat wall that forms a very strong
recirculating eddy. Bank access on this side is not as easy as it could be, and like everything
else along this reach, infested with poison oak.<br>
<br>
Below this point, flat paddling is occasionally broken up by short class 2-3 rapids of no real
notability. After 2 1/2 more miles, take out at the end of the driveable road at Railroad Flat
campsite.<br>
<br>
<strong>RAILROAD FLAT TO HWY 49 AT BAGBY</strong><br>
There is no road access from this point to the take out at Bagby, where the river crosses under a
bridge on Hwy 49 north of Mariposa. The old railroad bed turns into a foot and mountain bike
trail along the river right side. Take out at Bagby has changed hands in the past couple of
years, may have been purchased by state or fed. park mgt. ageny. The precise status is unknown
(other than it is available and can be used) at this time to the author; I intend to make another
run down this way in the near future, and will then be able to pass on the most current info.<br>
<br>
The first mile or two below Railroad Flat is enjoyable and acenic, if not particularly
challenging. The prime feature of this section is a rapid called &quot;Quarter Mile.&quot;
Actualy feeling more like a half mile, it is a tighter channel with continuous pool and drop
features that can be boat scouted along the way, eddy hopped and dropped with continuous
amusement at low to moderate flows. At higher flows, this could prove to be a significant and
ugly trap.<br>
<br>
<em>Immediately - 50 ft? - at the end of Quarter Mile is an impassible Class 6 called North Fork
Falls, where the North Fork of the Merced joins the Main Merced. There are several very large
flat and blocky boulders that much of the river flows UNDERNEATH! If there is even the slightest
chance of missing this mandatory portage, don&#39;t!</em><br>
<br>
At North Fork Falls, there is a pipe skid rig up the right side for rafter use. This is a short
portage if one continues down lessening Class 2/3 rapids, and ending at the upper end of Lake
McClure if the lake is full, and continuing to Bagby if the lake is low. The alternative for
kayakers is to portage the 3(?) miles back up to Railroad Flat. Quarter Mile rapid is fun enough
that I have endured this portage more than once and not for the last time.<br>
<br>
<strong>THE GOVERNMENT &quot;RULING&quot; AGENCIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</strong><br>
As a friend and I discovered while organizing a &quot;first annual&quot; river clean-up on the
Merced in 2001, the concept of a &quot;responsible agency&quot; is a wonderfully (literally, you
can&#39;t help but wonder...)convoluted situation. Here goes my best try -<br>
<br>
BLM claims responsibility for the waterway itself outside the boundary of Yosemite National Park
at &quot;Parkline.&quot; BLM also has land management responsibilities near and below Briceburg,
including campgrounds and picnic areas. <a href="http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/fo/folsom/mercedriverrec.html" target="newlink">BLM Merced River
Recreation Area</a><br>
<br>
National Park Service - Yosemite NP has an &quot;administrative&quot; site that makes them the
effective law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical entity in El Portal, from Parkline to
roughly the Foresta Bridge at Red Bud.<br>
<br>
There are private homes periodically along the banks in the upper sections around and below El
Portal. For the most part, paddlers are at least tolerated. Obviously, respect for the few
driveways, etc. is a good thing. El Portal is ruled by the National Park Service (with occasional
assistance from Mariposa County Sheriff&#39;s office), who owns/operates the majority of the town
as an administrative site in support of Yosemite National Park. In theory and as a general rule,
as in Yosemite Valley itself, in order to be a resident one must work for either the NPS-Yosemite
or the private concessioner businesses in the Park or in El Portal.<br>
<br>
The US Forest Service has two units involved. The south bank between El Portal and the BLM
downstream is part of the Sierra National Forest (includes the South Fork Merced, once it leaves
Yosemite NP near Wawona). The north bank between Red Bud and the BLM area, including a number of
picnic/campground areas, is part of Stanislaus National Forest. Somewhat curiously here, but
somehow in keeping with the theme of this governmental cluster-mix, there is a resident
California State Parks presence (a man named Sam Luna) below Red Bud in the USFS
campground/picnic areas.<br>
<br>
Cal. State Hwy Patrol shares the highway with the Mariposa County Sheriff&#39;s Office and NPS
Yosemite in El Portal. The Sheriff&#39;s SAR team is ultimately responsible for problems in the
river; NPS El Portal/Yosemite is also involved, and usually closer.<br>
<em>Thankfully in all this, -911 works well and gets the help needed once a call can be placed;
<strong>note that cel phones and radios both have significant dead spots in the Merced River
Canyon.</strong></em><br>
<br>
<strong>GROCERIES, BEER, LODGING, AND CAMPING</strong><br>
Groceries and supplies can be purchased at the El Portal Market, a small store that has most
essentials. If tolerated, one can also buy more limited supplies at Cedar Lodge and at the
Yosemite View Lodge at Parkline. Both of the latter are large hotel complexes in the Merced River
Canyon, owned by the same individual. In 2001, the Cedar Lodge management asked us to pass on
that kayakers were no longer welcome in their parking lot or on their beach across the road. So
be it, there&#39;s other places to buy beer and park/shuttle. They do have a bar and restaurant.
Yosemite View Lodge or &quot;Parkline&quot; does have a decent pizza, if they are open, a bar and
a restaurant. The Yosemite Bug Hostel at the top of the Briceburg grade on Hwy 140 has a small
restaurant with limited and usually good fair. Your best options for any real-world selection in
groceries, camping supplies, restaurant fair, etc. are in Mariposa or before you leave home.<br>
<br>
CAMPING can be had at a number of USFS and BLM primitive campgrounds/sites below Red Bud/Foresta
Bridge on river right, and below Briceburg as well. All are &quot;first come, first served.&quot;
There are roughly 30+ BLM sites below Briceburg spread between McCabe Flat, Willow Placer, and
Railroad Flat. There is a $10/night/site self-registration fee, and a limit of eight persons per
site; I did not see a stay limit when checked in March 2002, but there probably is or will be one
soon. Most weekends during any real flow levels will find all these areas full, especially as
summer gets closer; week days have had sites usually available in past years. The commercial
Indian Flat campground just up-canyon from Cedar Lodge (a whole separate business/owner) has been
recommended by out-of-town paddlers/friends I&#39;ve talked to.<br>
<br>
For those willing to spend $140+/day/room (off season), Cedar Lodge and The Yosemite View Lodge
at &quot;Parkline&quot; (it&#39;s old name) seem to have grown big enough in the past several
years to always have rooms available; I understand that the &quot;in season&quot; prices, usually
starting around Easter and lasting into the early fall, may go over $250/night in 2002. Both of
these facilities are owned by the same local tycoon; Cedar Lodge is the spot noted where the
Hotel Management asked me to pass on that kayakers were not welcome in her parking lot or on her
beach across the street.<br>
<br>
The Yosemite Bug Hostel, at the top to the Briceburg Grade on Hwy 140 heading out of the river
canyon going back toward Mariposa is a growing local business with a fast growing reputation for
good food, friendly and inexpensive accomodations in several configurations - cabin, bunkhouse,
tent sites, etc. There are other options in and outside Mariposa.<br>
<br>
<strong>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK</strong><br>
Camping and staying inside Yosemite National Park can be expensive, frustrating to arrange, and a
real hassle unless one really wants to plan their trip for this well in advance. Check the
various park websites for details, listed below in no particular order of desirability, even
though I do get paid by at least two of them. Also, a head&#39;s up if you don&#39;t frequent the
National Parks System - the entrance fee, good for 7 days, is $20.00/car. These fees are now
retained by the Park management and used to fund a number (albeit usually controversial at some
level) of long overdue park infrastructure improvements. If you&#39;ve never been and seen John
Muir&#39;s second favorite big hole in the ground, do so if there&#39;s any way possible. I came
here for a few months many years ago, and so may be a little on the prejudice side. The scenery
here continues to be mind-blowing, even having lived on the Valley floor for years!<br>

This is a common put in for people who wish to boat the many class 4 rapids between here and Redbud.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put in at the small parking spots on the down-canyon end of the bridge, better on the upstream (east/upcanyon lane) side of the bridge. There is room for 3 cars if all think/plan accordingly when parking on this side.</p>

</div>
</div> 
<p>
The river splits around the island, with the left channel as a sneak route, and the right channel with two Class IV drops.&nbsp; The two drops are formed by jagged rocks that can have some pin/carnage potenial at lower flows.&nbsp;&nbsp; At higher flows both&nbsp;channels have&nbsp;large holes that are&nbsp;difficult to avoid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Chipped Tooth comes very quickly after Nightmare Island, with only a short distance of fast water between them. The river starts off wide then drops through a steep boulder field towards a narrow exit.&nbsp; The middle is congested but right and left sides are more open.</p>
<p>
The right side of Chipped Tooth seems moderately easier than the left [highly subjective, I admit]; at low-moderate flows, it can be eddy-hopped down small right bank eddys up to the steep boulder pour-throughs; at moderate-higher flows, this route still works to paddle through if you can&#39;t or don&#39;t hit the narrow bank eddys. The left side goes as well at most flows, but the sudden large left-right &quot;reversals&quot; - waves, not holes - towards the bottom can be hard to manage.<br/>
<br/>
<em>BEWARE - the largest drop and the &quot;Chipped Tooth&quot; is formed by a group of large boulders going across the river bed, with very real sieve/trap potential if one were out of the boat or in a bad position at most flows.</em><br/>
<br/>
In 1999(?) a local paddler and friend in a relatively small boat missed the boof over the middle; he penciled, and found himself pinned flat, still in his boat, at the bottom of the river. He escaped barely, and spent the next day and a half retrieving his boat via high line and hook-and-pole.</p>

<p>
Split Rock can sneak up on the unwary. At low/moderate flows, this shouldn&#39;t be a problem as the route is pretty much straight down the middle in the tongue. At moderate/higher flows, some scary holes can form, and this rapid becomes essentially one with the next rapid, a somewhat harder (at most flows) rapid called &quot;Corner Pocket&quot; for very good reason.</p>
<br>
<br clear=right>
</div><div id='zzqhkbkclmci8lsRiverRapidView79' class='CRiverRapidView-view CRiverRapidView'> <b><a name="rapid14204">Corner Pocket</a></b> (Class IV, Mile -91.6)<br>
<p>
Corner Pocket can be scouted and portaged at the campground on river right, McCabe Flat. It is a rocky angular pore-over several feet tall, at the bottom of a rocky lead-in. If one enters or gets pushed too far to the left, you end up in the Corner Pocket at the bottom, river left. The first time I saw this feature, I watched six kayaks follow into this like lemmings. All six ended up swimming out, with the boats tumbling in the pocket for later retrieval. The current below the pore-over splits, and the left flow goes up against a flat wall that forms a very strong recirculating eddy. Bank access on this side is not as easy as it could be, and like everything else along this reach, infested with poison oak.</p>
<p>
It is common to take out at the campground immediately below Corner Pocket.</p>

<p>
Quarter Mile Rapid has a tighter channel with continuous pool and drop features that can be boat scouted along the way, eddy hopped and dropped with continuous amusement at low to moderate flows. At higher flows, the drops blend together and there is the great danger of being swept into North Fork Falls.</p>
