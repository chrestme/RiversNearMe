<h2>River Description</h2>
The Toccoa and the Ocoee are the same river; it is the "Toccoa" from its headwaters on the Blue
Ridge in Georgia until it crosses north into Tennessee.<br>
<br>
This is the official Forest Service "Toccoa River Canoe Trail" which runs from Deep Hole campground
down to Sandy Bottoms. Rapids are class I-II with one set in the middle that approaches class III.
Butt Bridge and Toccoa Valley Campground offer alternate takeouts and shorter runs; 8 miles and 11
miles respectively. There is a good fisherman's parking lot on Dial Road about a mile below Butt
Bridge - neither of the bridges afford great parking opportunities. There is NO access in the
5-mile wilderness section between Margret and Butt Bridge, so bring extra food & water, first aid
kit, footgear etc and be prepared as if you were hiking the backcountry.<br>
<br>
It's a spectacular all-day wilderness cruising section or 2-day overnighter and a good training run
for intermediate paddlers. Spud kayakers will have not much fun as there are some very long
stretches of slack water. Take the long boat if you are planning to kayak this one, or be prepared
to do a lot of tedious wallowing along. There is no park-and-play worth mentioning on this
reach.<br>
<br>
The river runs close along state highway 60 a couple miles from Deep Hole to the town of Margret,
then heads west into the National Forest around the back side of Tooni Mountain. The next few miles
are dense wilderness with no easy access in or out. Midway, the Benton MacKaye hiking trail crosses
the river over a suspension footbridge. A set of class II-III drops separated by wide eddies starts
under the bridge and continues for a couple hundred yards through a shallow gorge. This rapid is
known locally as "the Margret Drifts" - look out for driftwood. You may not notice the bridge
coming up until you are there, due to thick woods, but it can be spotted if you look ahead as you
approach down a long westerly straightaway. Find the clearings along the right or left bank just
upstream and pull out to scout. Scouting is difficult to impossible from the riverbanks. It's a
messy riverbed portage if you elect to walk it, forget trying to get down on the banks; the woods
are thick, steep and virtually trailless adjacent to the rapids. Best scouting overlook is on the
bridge (see photos). There are good campsites here if you want to stay overnite. You can hike the
trail back to highway 60 a few miles to the north to get out if necessary. It is difficult, but not
impossible, to haul back up to the bridge once you've run down the ledges, if you wanted to do
multiple runs whilst camping. Look out for snakes.<br>
<br>
A few miles on, the river leaves the National Forest, continues through some scenic farm country,
under a couple of backroad bridges, through some more pasture, finally past the Toccoa Valley
campground on the left, then to Sandy Bottoms another mile or two beyond. Whitewater throughout
this pleasant piece is limited to pretty small stuff; relax and enjoy the float.<br>
<br>
There was a river-use conflict with a landowner below Margret in 2003 which is mostly settled but
this depends on the responsible behavior of boaters. Fishing rights are still disputed. The Forest
Service has very clearly marked the disputed 3000 feet of riverfront with many obvious large signs,
and another pair of signs at the downstream end lets you know that you are re-entering the National
Forest (where once again you can basically raise hell and do as you please). While boating through
the private property please:<br>
<br>
1&gt; Do not trespass or set foot on the private land.<br>
2&gt; Do not fish.<br>
3&gt; Keep the noise down.<br>
4&gt; Be courteous to the landowner and his friends.<br>
<br>
Please help promote community awareness of landowner rights issues.<br>

Ran from Deep Hole to VanZant/Daniel Bridge (Newport Rd) at 300cfs with two recreational kayaks and<br/>
one tandem canoe. On the water about 7hours with a long lunch at and two portages and several<br/>
disaster recoveries. Previously my wife and I paddled Etowah through WMA with four college age<br/>
girls and they were all asking for something a little bit more challenging. This looked manageable<br/>
for a couple of newbies.....Be careful what you ask for. Great river, nice variety of what should<br/>
be challenging or entertaining shoals/sections, but maybe is NOT suitable for inexperienced or ill<br/>
equipped kayakers at this 300cfs water level. Something of an admission of guilt despite my years<br/>
of lake canoeing and three other kayak trips with my wife just this year. Oversimplified, many of<br/>
the ledges are difficult to spot and are quite shallow. It is easy to get hung up and turned<br/>
sideways. Note, our friends in a tandem canoe made it through without incident...couple close calls<br/>
which are expected. Regarding general hazards....... Similar to July post ......Two deadfalls early<br/>
on, first within 30minutes is passable on far left. At higher flows, have to believe it is full<br/>
blocked....second is within another 30minutes and it is a floater? which we had to portage over.<br/>
For those unwilling to ran the rapid on river right at Margret Drifts after swinging bridge, there<br/>
is an easier passage far left which takes you to a lower pool which you can then exit and portage a<br/>
kayak on shore around the final severe ledge/chute. Not sure if a canoe would make it through the<br/>
underbrush ....My mistake was bringing my wife's kayak down river left, portaging, and after going<br/>
back up for my kayak, watching my canoe friends go right with success, I then followed, and swamped<br/>
at the bottom...almost made it. I should have recognized the risk of swamping at the bottom wave<br/>
section avoided. I should have just started and stayed left as I did for my wife.. Contrary to the<br/>
River Description / Rapids advice for Margret Drifts, at 300cfs, once you start right, there is no<br/>
path to the middle that either of us could see while scouting from bridge and from shore.....once<br/>
at bottom, left is available, but there is no obvious path left once you start down that right<br/>
chute. I regret not having a skirt for the sit in kayaks. My wife swamped at least six times, and<br/>
twice very nearly injured herself severely on what should have been modest or easy sections. Rookie<br/>
mistakes getting hung up and a little sideways. I swamped twice. As a side note, a group of three<br/>
was putting in behind us and the outfitter who provided for them sent spotters out looking at end<br/>
of the day and we had not . Despite at least two hours of lunch/portage/disaster recovery time, we<br/>
never saw them. An hour or so later we saw one of the three hanging on to the back of the four<br/>
wheeler headed to take out location. </div>

Great trip yesterday! 5 of us made the paddle from Deep Hole to Doublehead gap yesterday. Flow was<br/>
perfect at about 970cfs. Be careful there are four trees completely accross the river. The first is<br/>
just after the fish hatchery bridge, then another just a little bit down past there, then another a<br/>
half mile down and the last just after you enter the National Forest area before the swinging<br/>
bridge. We portaged all four of the strainers. </div>

A short distance from the put-in at Deep Hole, a large tree is blocking about 95%of the river.<br/>
Passage is possible on the far left, but it's a tight squeeze. Othewise, it was a great trip this<br/>
time, with water levels around 415cfs (just don't ask about how we swamped the canoe just past the<br/>
Swinging Bridge!). </div>

A canoe should be fine. A canoe with a keel might not be the best choice, but even that should be<br/>
OK, as long as you have some river experience (the keel makes it difficult to quickly turn the<br/>
canoe - very important in fast water). 400cfs is fine, any less and I'd think twice, expecially if<br/>
you've never done this section before. I've done it at 335, but it wasn't fun. If you put in at<br/>
Deep Hole by 9 am, you'll make it to Sandy Bottom in plenty of time to make it to the Toccoa<br/>
Riverside Restaurant for an early dinner. Please remember that you will be out in the wilderness<br/>
for most of the trip. No cellphone service, and a VERY long hike. Take friends in a second canoe in<br/>
case you have problems. But definately worth the trip! Sam </div>

Kayaked from Deep Hole to Sandy Bottoms over the weekend with friends and had a great run. Thanx to<br/>
heavy rains recently the river was well over 900cfs...probably closer to 1000cfs. Not much time to<br/>
relax as the water was moving pretty quick almost the entire way. The 5-6 hour trip most people<br/>
report took us less than 4 hours from launch to packed up and driving back to the campground....and<br/>
we stopped for lunch at the suspension bridge. This was my first run on the Toccoa so I'm not sure<br/>
what it's normally like but at this level it's fast and choppy almost the whole way. You will want<br/>
to stop at the suspension bridge and check out the rapids downstream. We started just to the right<br/>
of center as we crossed under the bridge and crossed to river left in order to avoid a rather<br/>
intimidating rapid on the right. That was as far as we could see from the bridge. There are plenty<br/>
of rapids beyond your line of sight from the bridge but with this flow all lines seemed pretty<br/>
good. At this level I don't really think this run is good for a beginner unless you have a really<br/>
stable boat and someone experienced along to help out. I don't think there were any really tricky<br/>
spots or dangerous rapids but if you flip the swift current makes it difficult to get to shore,<br/>
retrieve lost gear or even find a dry spot to empty your boat and get back in again. With that<br/>
said, the 5 of us had a great run, although, everyone agreed it would have been nice if the flow<br/>
was down a bit so that there was time to just float and enjoy the scenery. For those<br/>
interested...we paddled 2 Dagger Crossfires, 2 Wilderness Systems Tsunamis and an Old Town<br/>
recreation kayak. </div>

Sorry Wesley, I didn't see your note until we returned. I hope you were able to go. My group put in<br/>
at Deep Hole on Tuesday, May 5th, with the water level around 500 cfs. Within 100 yards, the other<br/>
canoe had already flipped (yes, we laughed). After we got them emptied out and going again, the<br/>
dangers still lurked. About 30 minutes later, a goose, apparently upset at us for doing nothing<br/>
more than drifting with the current, decided to charge the other boat (same guys that had just<br/>
gotten dunked). We assumed it had a nest nearby, but we didn't see it. We managed to escape the<br/>
clutches of the angry waterfowl, and continued our journey. There was one downed log a short<br/>
distance before the swinging bridge, but due to the higher water levels, we managed to slide across<br/>
the top of it (along the left side). At normal water levels, I'm sure it will be a problem. We<br/>
stopped at the Swinging Bridge for lunch, and also noted the &quot;No Camping&quot; signs on the left bank.<br/>
We did not check the right bank. We scouted the shoals, both from atop the bridge and along the<br/>
left bank. The second canoe was fairly inexperienced, and they were concerned about making it<br/>
through safely, so they decided to portgage around. My partner and I decided to give it a shot, and<br/>
somehow made it through with our dignity intact. The remainder of the trip was uneventful, other<br/>
than enjoying the rapid water flow (we averaged about 4.8mph for the entire trip). We did encounter<br/>
an unmarked cable strung across the river about 3/4 of the way to Sandy Bottom. At normal river<br/>
levels, it won't be a problem, but anything a foot or two higher than we had and it might catch an<br/>
unsuspecting canoist in the head. I warned the second canoe as we approached the takeout at Sandy<br/>
Bottom, and suggested they stay close to the right bank (the water gets a little bumpy for the last<br/>
100 yards, and if you're on the left bank, you might have difficulty reaching the takeout). Sure<br/>
enough, they blasted though a chute, and managed to turn sideways on a rock, swamping the canoe<br/>
again! I laughed so hard I cried. Due to the high water levels, we managed the trip in four hours<br/>
exactly. We all had a wonderful trip (except for the bruised egos in the second canoe!) and can't<br/>
wait to plan another trip. Sam </div>

A friend and I had a great overnighter on the Toccoa this past Friday/Saturday. Water was running a<br/>
little over 500 cfs which was great. There was a solid push all the way with very few &quot;dead zones&quot;.<br/>
I can imagine that even at the recommended minimum 350 cfs, you would have to watch your lines to<br/>
avoid scrapes. Two deadfalls are present above Margret's Drifts. I'm not sure how far upstream but<br/>
they were easy to spot. I don't know if they constitute a warning flag either, but we did watch<br/>
three guys in a canoe flip trying to go around the first. I've flagged it just to be sure. The<br/>
first tree has a passable gap on river left. The second tree stretches the full river width and we<br/>
had to portage around it. Not easy, but doable. Both trees are a foot or more thick and will<br/>
probably be there for quite some time. Forrest Service has posted a &quot;No Camping&quot; sign on river left<br/>
at the Swinging Bridge just above M.D. I don't know how new the sign is, but we spoke with a fellow<br/>
camper who said it was posted because of excessive littering. No sign on river right, but the ban<br/>
may still cover this area too. Camp here at your own judgment. Several primative camp sites are<br/>
open and available just before and just after the Drifts, though. Good trout fishing. 500 cfs made<br/>
the Drifts look a little indimidating with our boats loaded with gear. No problems running them in<br/>
the morning, though. We actually had an interesting encounter with a family in four canoes that<br/>
split their party up because some of the younger ones didn't want to run the Drifts. There really<br/>
is no hiking around these rapids. The family finally connected up after more than an hour . . .<br/>
back at the bridge with all four boats more than a mile downstream. It was a reminder to me that<br/>
scouting and proper planning are essential even on a relatively flat river like this one. If you<br/>
MUST walk around the Drifts, try the right river bank. Forget portaging all the way, but an<br/>
intimidated passenger might be able to walk around this way. The rest of the trip was great. A<br/>
little cold for the morning run, but very nice. At the present water level, we estimated that the<br/>
trip could be done in 6 hours if you stopped for lunch. I took a good many photos. I'll try and<br/>
post some later. - Austin </div>

Kevin: Austin, I'd have to say go for it. It's gonna be low, but as my post says below, me and my<br/>

170. It was a chore, but we still managed to have fun. If you're gonna run it, do it now. The flows<br/>
will be dismal as summer draws nearer, and your only hope then will be to get lucky and catch it<br/>
after a bunch of rain. At least now it's staying consistently at around 300, which is doable but<br/>
not ideal. </div>

The river might be passable at 300 cfs or so in an unloaded kayak, but I wouldn't try it any lower<br/>

You're braver than I am! The last time I canoed this section (with camping gear - about 2 years<br/>
ago), it was around 335 cfm, and I thought that was marginal at best. I had hoped to do this<br/>
section again this week, but not with the water this low. Instead, I canoed the section from the<br/>
Lake Blue Ridge dam downstream (north) to Copper Hill, TN. There is a small park right at the state<br/>
line with a boat ramp. The trip took about 5 hours, but was very rocky for the first 3 hours or so.<br/>
It seemed the water level was a little lower than &quot;normal&quot;, even though it is controlled by the<br/>
dam. </div>

Me and my girlfriend just did a two day camping run on this through the national wilderness part in<br/>
a 1980 Mad River canoe with about 130 pounds of gear. This was at a level extremely low; I'm<br/>
thinking 170 cfs at the very best. But even though the trip was hard work, I'll still have to<br/>
qualify this as one of the best wilderness excursions I've had in a long time. It's technical to<br/>
run this tandom with gear, but it can be done as long as you accept you'll have to walk your boat<br/>
off rocks not too infrequently. No tree barriers are impassible unless you're in a large boat. The<br/>
rapids are entry level, but I would recommend at least one person on the trip to have experience,<br/>
because this could give the casual float trip seeker a really long day. If you're looking for some<br/>
great Georgia scenery and wilderness, then take the trip. Just be prepared for the hard work ahead. </div>

Took several buddies from work down this section of the river (Deep Hole to Sandy Bottom) May<br/>
29-30, and camped at the swinging bridge. Water level was around 335 cfs or so. I was a little<br/>
worried but, despite a few scrapes over some rocks early on, we didn't have any real problems due<br/>
to the low water level (of course, it would have helped if we hadn't lugged so much gear in the<br/>
canoes!).<br/>
<br/>
Found some serious littering from previous campers at the bridge. We cleaned up what we could.<br/>
Otherwise, the entire trip was almost pristine.<br/>
<br/>
The deadfall Rick mentioned, just past the bridge, was easily passible by ducking under it. At<br/>
higher water levels, it will cause problems, but portaging should be fairly easy there.<br/>
<br/>
This section can be done in 2 very easy days, or even in one day if you're in a hurry (maybe 8<br/>
hrs?). During our trip, water averaged 3-4 mph most places, 4-5 in some. </div>

New deadfall (red oak with leaves still green) all the way across the river about a half mile<br/>

The Toccoa is a beautiful river with some great camping spots along the way, do be careful for<br/>
nearly half of the river banks are privatley owned and there have been reports of owners with<br/>
shotguns. Watch out for fisherman, sometimes they are hiding in nice eddy's hidden by the rocks.<br/>
Generally this is a great river for people that are just starting out. A word of caution, in a<br/>
matter of minutes (what feels like minutes) this river can scare up some nasty rapids if it starts<br/>
to rain hard. I found myself going over margret drifts for the second time in a week.. only this<br/>
time it had started raining within a half hour of puting in at Deep Hole. MD went from a regular<br/>
class II rapid with some nice lines to a bucking menace with some deep holes and lines that run you<br/>
into log jams on the right side. Other wise this river is absolutely a pleasure, and I know I will<br/>
be going back.<br/>
<br/>
A special thanks to the Forest Ranger that is in charge of Deep Hole, he was able to help us in<br/>
ways that no one else could. :)<br/>

Ran it 9/11/2004 with 12 members of GCA at 400 cfs. Two days previous it was at 1400 cfs following<br/>
