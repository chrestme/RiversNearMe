<h2>River Description</h2>
<p>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">UPDATE 2014.03.09: Changes to the powerhouse have been
completed, so flow in the main channel is once again reduced by hydro demands. Do not rely on
&#39;color coding&#39; to accurately reflect runnability conditions for this run.</span>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>For information on flow through the dam,
c</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>lick this link to go to <a href="http://www.kaukaunautilities.com/environment/default.asp?CategoryNumber=5&amp;SubcategoryNumber=1" target="blank"><strong>Kaukauna Utilities</strong></a>.</strong><br>
<br>
Even when there is not sufficient flow from the dam for the upper reach, it <em>may</em> be
possible to play some of the spots below the lower dam. If you drive here and find the main
(upper) channel dry or too tame, don&#39;t leave before checking the Thousand Islands area! Be
aware that mid-to-late summer water quality may be affected by algae blooms in Lake Winnebego. (I
was through the area July 24, 2013, and the water quite literally looked like pea soup, though
this may not be an every year situation.)</span>

<p>
<b>Quick Facts:</b><br>
<br>
Location: Downtown Kaukauna.<br>
Shuttle Length: 1.4 miles. (See details in &quot;Directions&quot; Tab.)<br>
Character: Bedrock riverbed creates sweet waves for surfs and spins. The first part of this run
is heavily &#39;citified&#39; (stonework banks, highway and railway crossings, buildings and
industry surrounding), the second part is braided channels between wooded islands within a nature
preserve.<br>
<br>
Put-in is approximately 643&#39; elevation.<br>
Take-out is approximately 602&#39; elevation.<br>
Thus total elevation change is approximately 41&#39;.<br>
<br>
<b>General Overview</b><br>
<br>
A fine stretch of sloping bedrock between and below a couple of dams allows boaters some
convenient &#39;in town&#39; exercise. In fact, this stretch has grown quite a following. With
its east-central Wisconsin location, boaters are coming from throughout the state (and beyond!)
to catch this when it has good flows.<br>
<br>
A few features may be regainable (depending on water level, hull speed, and boater skill). Most
of the features, however, will be catch-on-the-fly one-shot play. Eddies are
<strong>very</strong> few in this reach, especially as water levels increase. Most of the river
(at most sane boatable flows) will be too shallow for vertical moves in most features, but
various waves and holes should allow a great mix of surfs and spins.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Caution: A potentially dangerous dam interrupts this reach
of river.</span> The dam (between Part II and Part III, as defined below) angles across the
river, river-right to river-left. The rightmost river-channel (above the dam) is the outflow from
a powerhouse which will almost always carry significant flow, causing strong crosscurrents as the
dam diverts virtually all that flow across to river-left. Excellent water reading skills and full
knowledge and confidence in setting a ferry-angle to paddle across strong flows will be necessary
to successfully negotiate this section of the river.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">The braided channel and significant walled-in, fenced-in,
and private property areas along the river make getting out of the river <strong>not an
option</strong> through most of this reach. For these reasons, it is highly recommended that
<strong>this section should not be boated alone, nor by beginner boaters without the company of
experienced boaters for safety.</strong></span> (That said, experienced, skilled whitewater
boaters should not be at all intimidated by this reach.)<br>
<br>
The Lower section (Part III below) can be paddled down to around 4,000 cfs. Access for that is
typically by parking at 1000 Islands Nature Center, paddling/ferrying over to an island, to carry
across and up into the &quot;Hidden Channel&quot; to surf <i>Mystery Wave</i>. Levels of 4,000 to
7,000 cfs make this wave quite fun, with fast carving and spins/roundhouses possible. River right
eddy service is available at the lower flows.
</p>
<p>

<p>
<br>
The reach starts by putting in from the parking lot of the RiverView Middle School. It is
recommended to walk upstream under the Main Street (Highway 55) bridge to a corner in the
chain-link fence. Pass boats over the fence and carefully lower them down to the river. In the
river, a fair sized cement pier with manhole cover should facilitate put-in here.<br>
<br>
Note: Some boaters (before putting in) may hike upstream to look at the larger dam above this
reach. At some flows, a couple powerful waves may form in the outflow from that upper dam. Any
boaters who may be considering a tricky put-in up here (to try some surfs on those waves) should
be aware that these waves are formed by a &#39;rubble pile&#39; of slab rock which looks almost
like heaps of broken concrete. Extreme caution is advised! (In general, this is just <i>not</i>
worth the effort, and very few boaters will ever bother.)<br>
<br>
Right in front of the Middle school (at lower water levels -- one or two gates) is <strong>Ten
Boat Wave</strong>, a smooth, glassy wave which (when well formed) appears you could have ten
people surfing at once. Smaller play boats may have difficulty staying on this wave at certain
levels. A cylindrical cement pier (with manhole cover) forms a <em>minor</em> eddy a ways out
from the left shore/wall. Boaters <em>may</em> be able to attain and regain the wave from here,
but it will take some effort and skill. At levels above &#39;one-gate&#39;, this will become
submerged and provide no refuge. At about 1.5 gates, a great breaking wave (<b>Wall Wave</b>) can
form against the concrete wall on surfer&#39;s left (river-right). Tricky eddy service along this
wall is possible
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
Just downstream you will pass under a bridge (Island Street at Oak Street). Just
right-of-center (just to the left of the river-right bridge-support-pier in the river),
<strong>Island Street Wave</strong> should allow surfs and spins. Surfers-right becomes an
outstanding &quot;western style&quot; surf experience at levels over 11,000 cfs.
Surfers-left provides for a great carving surf. Don&#39;t miss the set of waves just below,
which can be difficult to catch, but worth the effort.

<p>
<br>
Another pair of smooth waves (<b>Wall Wave II</b>) forms river-right and below (pretty much
against the right wall). Eddy service can be possible at lower flows, but generally (more often)
will be one-shot play. A railroad bridge crosses just below, and there are signs warning of the
dam downstream.<br>
<br>
If you can&#39;t catch the features you want your first time down (or want to do them again), one
option is to head to the right shore near the railroad trestle just downstream. Some recent
shoreline boulder work provides a small eddy just below the trestle. This option (which appears
to exist only at low/medium levels) will allow you to carry back up to the put in, for repeat
play on the features outlined above.

<br>
Immediately below the railroad bridge, a large island splits the channel. From here there are two
options:<br>
<br>
A) <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><u>Left channel (from the railroad bridge)</u></span><br>
<br>
Swiftwater (tripping over shallow rubble on channel-left which <em>may</em> at some levels create
some minor features) leads to a pair of wave/holes to the right of the channel (<strong>Goose
Ledges</strong>, in honor of the Canada Geese which regularly &#39;watch&#39; the action from the
river-left bank/wall). The upper is the more well-formed, and may allow surfs and spins. (Both
have no eddies, and will be catch-on-the-fly.)<br>
<br>
Just downstream, some minor waves precede a road bridge (Elm Street). Now it&#39;s another
decision point -- left or right. A wave tight river-right, upstream of the bridge, appears
enticing, and sets you up for an eddy immediately downstream of the bridge. From there you can
readily stage for <strong>Pancake Wave</strong> (see second paragraph and picture below).
Otherwise, head to far left to catch action immediately below the bridge.
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">
The leftmost section of the bridge has a small pocket-wave immediately downstream, while
the second-from-the-left section has a better wave/hole on it&#39;s right side immediately
under the bridge. Eddy service may be minimal, so if you and your friends all want to have
a shot at it, it may be best to queue upstream waiting to take turns. However, chosing this
option means missing the river-right wave upstream of the bridge, and may make catching the
next wave (more on river right) tough.

Sloping bedrock leads to <strong>Pancake Wave</strong> (center-to-right) which may provide
some sweet surfs. There is a distinct right and left side to the wave, and most boaters
should be able to cross between the two. However, your exit move will end your turn on this
wave (you can&#39;t regain it at most flows). At higher levels, a couple good waves also
form tight to river-left where there is a large eddy behind.<br>
<br>
Looking downstream from this point, one will see the lower dam on this reach. Even though
the river has been split by an island, this channel is quite wide. Boaters must make a
ferry all the way across the channel toward the island (to the right) for the next part of
the river.

<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 100);">Another warning: Beaching a boat for a throw-rope rescue
is likely to be difficult or futile. Anyone missing a roll or swimming will be swept quickly
toward the <strong>dam</strong>, which varies from <strong>about four to seven feet in
height</strong>, and (in this section) <strong>all lands hard</strong> on sloping bedrock (no
cushion, no boil). Rescue of a swimmer in the reach above the dam is most likely to be by
grabbing onto another boater&#39;s kayak and aggressively swimming and paddling to try to make it
to the island (channel-right shore) or to river left. If you are swept past the end of the island
(as a swimmer, or as a boater-with-swimmer-in-tow) odds are <strong>slim</strong> you will be
successful in avoiding being swept over the dam.</span><br>
<br>
When you have finished playing the features in this channel, head far to channel-right, and
<strong>immediately at the end of the island</strong>, hang a right, and paddle
&#39;upstream&#39; (parallel to the dam, against the diverted flow of the other channels), past
the outflow of the right channel (described below in &#39;option B&#39;), and into the outflow
from the powerhouse channel. The dam is much shorter on this side of the river than it is further
to river-left.<br>
<br>
At some flows, the <strong>center</strong> of this rightmost section of the dam <em>could</em> be
run, dropping about 2&#39; onto slab, sheeting horizontally 10&#39;(+/-) into a shallow
wave/hole. Being off center will drop you into a uniform boil (to either side). At higher water
levels, the entire width will be a very uniform low-head-dam/boiling hole. In all instances, it
may be difficult to judge (from the river upstream) just where it is potentially &#39;safe&#39;
to drop over. Therefore the <strong>recommended route</strong> is either tight to the right
shore, or well to the left of this section of dam, where trees dot small islands immediately
below the dam. In either of these locations, the flow off the dam spills onto a series of shallow
ledges, where one can quite safely bobble down. Generally the flow should easily allow
boat-scouting to pick a line in the clear spaces between tree-filled small islands.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 50, 255);">In all cases, it is highly recommended
<strong>all</strong> boaters take a close look at the dam from within <em>1000 Islands
Environmental Center</em> before running this reach. <strong>All</strong> should have a firm
visual impression of what they will need to do to successfully negotiate this area.</span> Done
correctly, it can be a piece of cake; done incorrectly it could really ruin your day. While
technically, it is not a &#39;class IV&#39; drop on the river, it is the reason for that rating
in the listing, just so less experienced paddlers are aware of the potential hazard it
represents.<br>
<br>
It is also possible (at various water levels) to drop over the dam at various other spots (to
skip the rightmost channel below the dam as described in Part III A below). Specifically, some
paddlers opt to paddle over a very low section of dam directly downstream from the big island for
more direct access into the Hidden Channel. There is a large dead tree on the island just below
the dam that can serve as a landmark for this line. Treat this seemingly simple move with respect
should you choose this line. There is no way to adequately scout these routes from shore, so they
should be done only by boaters well familiar with the reach.<br>
<br>
B) <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><u>Right channel (from the railroad
bridge)</u></span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(<strong>Not</strong> recommended at high flows, nor by
novice boaters at any flow!)</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 50, 255);">Before even considering running this channel, make
certain you scout from the Elm Road bridge (while running shuttle, before putting on), and make
careful assessment of the retentiveness of the holes, and your ability to handle this
area.</span> All novice boaters (and many others) at most levels should instead use the left
channel around the island (option A, as previously described).<br>
<br>
A small pocket wave leads to a wave-train passing under the next road bridge (Elm Street), which
has three piers, creating four &#39;tunnels&#39;. In the left, left-center, and right-center
tunnels, increasingly interesting (left-to-right) smooth-tongue waves form immediately under the
downstream edge of the bridge. The rightmost tunnel has a bigger ledge (and more dynamic hole!),
hidden well back under the bridge. At &#39;two-gates&#39;, this is a great ride, and there are
adequate eddies across the whole river (again, at &#39;two-gates&#39;) to allow repeat play, as
well as allowing play across all four of these waves (<strong>The Trolls</strong>)! Utmost
caution is urged, however, because of what lies downstream (as will be described below).<br>
<br>
Downstream, a route to <strong>far left</strong> leads through a series of waves over shallow
rocky debris and spills over a short ledge. A few diagonal waves and holes may allow surfs before
you spill into the slackwater below. A route to <strong>far right</strong> slides uniformly down
into a great looking wave, with a good eddy below on the right. However, the sloping bedrock
leading into it (coming downstream from the Trolls) has a slight right-to-left tilt.<br>
<br>
The <strong>entire center of this channel</strong> (immediately to the left of the just-mentioned
lower wave) drops over a short ledge and forms a <strong>very uniform hydraulic</strong> which
should be avoided by most boaters at almost all levels. The lower dam (mentioned by the warning
signs above the railroad bridge) is not far downstream. Anyone caught in the hydraulic who ends
up swimming will be swept toward the lower dam, and will be largely at the mercy of where the
currents take them to spill over the dam.

A) <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><u>Right channel</u></span><br>
<br>
Brief slackwater below the lower dam leads to another short wall/dam in this river-right channel.
Two sections of the wall/dam (just left-of-center) are broken out, creating a bit of a chute and
a wave below. These may be difficult to spot from in your boat until you are quite close. These
left-side chutes may provide some surfs and vertical possibilities, but care must be taken not to
get into the uniform part of the hydraulic formed by existing sections of the wall/dam. The
center of this short dam creates a wave/hole (<strong>Spin Cycle</strong>) which (at
low-to-moderate levels) allows effortless surfs and spins as the water sheets thinly across the
shallow bedrock and into a mushy foam pile. At higher levels this whole area may become quite
sticky and most may do well to avoid it. A viewing platform/pier extends into the river just
below, and provides a convenient place to exit. Doing so, however, misses some of the best play
waves on this river. Islands split the river into numerous braided channels (hence the name of
the area, &#39;1000 Islands&#39;).<br>
<br>
B) <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><u>Hidden (middle) channel</u></span><br>
<br>
Work your way left down narrow channels through the trees, and ferry across to a large island.
Beach and carry across the island (using deer-paths), then upstream to discover a wonderful set
of waves in a secluded channel. Carry up further on the ferry island nearly to the base of the
dam. You will cross one dry or swift flowing &quot;creek&quot; (overflow channel) to get to the
next flowing water about 30&#39; below base of the dam.<br>
<br>
Run this mini side-channel (leading away from the dam) which is about 80&#39; long and ends in a
sweet 4&#39; drop over <b>Infant Falls</b> You can easily scout the falls; A left/center line is
preferred. Make sure to miss the small hang-up rock in the middle of the channel about 12&#39;
above the lip of the falls. Great boof practice into a deep pool. Running the falls is a great
companion feature to the Mystery Wave at lower levels.

<b>Mystery Wave</b> (AKA &quot;Hidden Channel Wave&quot;) can be caught from an eddy just
upstream of the wave. Peel out into the strong current, and do your best to stall yourself
for a fast ride on a steep-faced wave. A couple more waves downstream may be surfed as
well, but caution is urged, as the outflow pushes straight into islands and trees. At
moderate-to-high water levels, those who miss the wave on their first attempt (and those
successful, looking for another ride) will need to get quickly to channel-left, take-out
and carry up for another attempt at these waves. (Eddy service is available at lower
flows.)

<br>
C) <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><u>Left channel</u></span>
</p>
<p>
As you exit the bottom of the Hidden Channel, you connect to the Left Channel. The Left Channel
features really come to life at a range of around 8,000 - 14,000 cfs. Water spilling off this
part of the dam flows across shallow sloping bedrock, and forms a smorgasbord of surfing
opportunities starting on far surfers left and culminating at far surfers right with the <b>Mill
Wave</b>. Mill Wave has good eddy service and becomes a bigger, better breaking wave at higher
levels, but don&#39;t forget how shallow the water is. A flip here may mean a close encounter
with the flat limestone riverbed.<br>
<br>
At higher flows, boaters may wish to carry up the bedrock and ferry across to a couple wide upper
waves which can provide good surfs. Fair eddy service exists to allow repeat play of these waves,
if they are well formed enough to entertain you.<br>
<br>
Once they&#39;ve had their fill, boaters will bobble down the remaining shallow rock-rubble
rapids, through more braided channel before the islands cease and the full width of the river
takes on the appearance of a large lake. Paddle across to the far right to the improved canoe
landing (just off Hwy.Z on Hwy.ZZ) to exit the river.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
While the description makes it sound lengthy, again, this is just a 1.5 mile reach, though you
will probably feel like you have paddled much further, as it can give you an excellent
workout.<br>
<br>
HUC has been &#39;fudged&#39; (to 04040003 rather than 04030204) to allow this reach to sort into
the &quot;Southwestern Lake Michigan&quot; drainage rather than the already overlarge
&quot;Northwestern Lake Michigan&quot; drainage. If this causes anyone trouble or concern, post a
note in the &quot;Comments&quot; tab.

<p>When in (I.E., at the right flows), a W-I-D-E wave forms here. Some of the first boaters to run this reach commented &quot;I bet you could surf ten boats across that wave!&quot; (I don't know whether that many boaters at once have ever been on this river to even have a chance at testing that theory. It would make quite a picture!) In general, (at most flows) it does not have a steep enough face for anything but straight-on front surfing. It also generally lacks any eddy, so if you miss it (or when you blow off of it) you are likely done.</p><br>
<br clear=right>

<p>Just beyond the bridge (and one of it's piers), a sweet wave/hole forms. At lower flows, it may be possible to regain from immediately below, but generally it will be catch-on-the-fly 'one shot' play. At moderate-to-high flows, this is an AWESOME playspot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just downstream and tight against the right shore (wall), another playable wave forms. At certain flows, paddlers may be able to regain this wave using a narrow slackwater along the wall.</p><br>

<p>Swiftwater (tripping over shallow rubble on channel-left which <em>may</em> at some levels create some minor features) leads to a pair of wave/holes to the right of the channel (<strong>Goose Ledges</strong>, in honor of the Canada Geese which regularly 'watch' the action from the river-left bank/wall). The upper is the more well-formed, and may allow surfs and spins. (Both have no eddies, and will be catch-on-the-fly.)</p><br>

<p>The leftmost section of the bridge has a small pocket-wave immediately downstream, while the second-from-the-left section has a better wave/hole on it's right side immediately under the bridge. Eddy service may be minimal, so if you and your friends all want to have a shot at it, it may be best to 'queue' upstream waiting to take turns.</p><p>-- OR --</p><p>Tight river-right, immediately upstream of the bridge, surf a juicy hole, catch the eddy behind the bridge pier, and stage for Pancake Wave 100' downstream.</p><br>

<p>The main flow of this channel (downstream of 'The Trolls') drops over a short ledge and forms a <strong>very uniform hydraulic</strong> which should be avoided by most boaters at almost all levels. The lower dam (mentioned by the warning signs above the railroad bridge) is not far downstream. Anyone caught in the hydraulic who ends up swimming will be swept toward the lower dam, and will be largely at the mercy of where the currents take them to spill over the dam.<br/>

<br/>
We will also recognize and note here that <em>experienced</em> boaters, familiar with this run, will also skip the (relatively tame action in the) right-most channel by 1000 Islands Nature Center, and drop over a spot more in the 'middle' of this wide, angled dam. Doing so puts them directly into the channel for the 'Mystery Wave'. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">We advise this be done only with someone who knows the route</span>, as it is difficult to describe here, and dropping over in the wrong spot could have very nasty outcomes.

(Edited info from &quot;BT100&quot; on 2014.03.09): Changes/updates to Kaukauna Utilities Badger plant have<br/>
been completed, so river flow in the bypassed channel will be back to the normal (reduced) flows.<br/>
(I.E., using the gauge for Fox River in Appleton, you must once again subtract 4,000 cfs to<br/>
approximate what the bypassed (natural) channel will be running here. As always, check the KU<br/>
website. At flows of 'three gates' or more, the normal put-in is very sketchy. For epic action on<br/>
&quot;Island St. Wave&quot;, some will still put in at the normal spot. For others, an option might be to<br/>
seal-launch downstream, below the railroad trestle on river left. Mystery Channel was outstanding,<br/>
Goose Ledges good too. </div>

5,600 cfs today Starting at 1000 Island Nature Center, ran the boney channel into the first main<br/>
channel going river left of 1000 Islands. This channel has Infant Falls up towards the base of the<br/>
dam. Perfect level to run the falls, 50 yards downstream was a great little sufing wave. Thinking<br/>
about taking the stand up board back for this one. This entire channel below Infant Falls is great<br/>
for beginners, couple eddies, a wave, ferrying, no consequence below. Next main channel over<br/>
(Hidden Channel) too much water for the Mystery Wave. Eddy modification continues on river right in<br/>
hopes of making wave attainment here more consistent. Alas, we were not shut out on surfing though.<br/>
20 yards downstream of the Mystery Wave was a super nice, fast wave- perfect for short playboats.<br/>
Eddy service to boot, but washing off meant a carry back up. Met an open boater from Appleton just<br/>
finishing up his day when we got there. Lake Winnebago gets drawn down in the fall. This lower<br/>
section should keep running thru October. Great color, great place to explore, features somewhat<br/>
limted, but definately still worth the effort. </div>
