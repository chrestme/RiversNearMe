<h2>River Description</h2>
<p>
Island Creek has been described as &quot;the Gem of the Cumberlands&quot;. It is certainly one of
the most scenic and continuous runs on the Cumberland Plateau.<br>
<br>
<br>
Over the last few years, we have made a concerted effort to remove the many strainers that had
made the river almost unboatable. We have done this in the most unobtrusive way leaving the river
aesthetics intact. <strong><em>However, please use utmost caution!!!</em> Due to pine beetle and
ice damage, there are numerous trees both upstream of the put-in and along the run that are
awaiting their turn to become a strainer. Therefore, be very alert just after high water. There
are a few logs in the creek but they are not in bad spots and no portages are required.&nbsp;
<u>Over the last several years downed trees have been cut up near the end of the run where the
last island is located down to the confluence with the Emory. The rapids in this lower part of
the creek have historically accumulated wood.&nbsp; Please use caution to look for any cut-up
wood or newly downed wood that might create a safety issue.</u></strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Access for the put-in on this lower reach of Island Creek is on Catoosa Road going southeast from
the game check station. While the area is controlled by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency
(TWRA), the 3/4 mile stretch of Catoosa Road to the low-water bridge put-in at Island Creek has
traditionally been open to traffic during managed hunts. The regional TWRA manager for the area
has said that the road would remain open to boaters accessing Island Creek during managed hunts.
I am in the process of getting that in writing.&nbsp;The Non-quota Turkey Hunt Handout shows
that&nbsp;Feb 1 thru March 29, 2013 is a wildlife rest period and access to the WMA is closed to
all users and no vehicle access is allowed. April 5-7, 12-14, 16-18,&nbsp;20-21 (Young Sportsman
Hunt), 23-25, 26-28, and&nbsp;Apr 30-May 2, 2013 are turkey hunts. During hunting days, the
Catoosa WMA access is restricted to all but hunters. There are <em>usually</em> signs posted
during hunts and rest periods alerting you that the area and roads are closed to access. There
may be a sign at the intersection warning you that the area is open only to Big Game Hunters.
Traditionally, the signs have only restricted the Catoosa Road leading west of the game check
station. There should only be &quot;STOP&quot; signs on the righthand road leading west up Island
Creek towards the Daddy&#39;s Creek takeout at Devil&#39;s Breakfast Table. If you are uncertain,
check at the Obed Wild and Scenic office in Wartburg or with TWRA. TWRA has fined boaters in the
past for illegal access and parking at river accesses in the WMA such as the Devil&#39;s
Breakfast Table parking area during restricted times. The fine has been as much as $142 per
person. TWRA Contact: Jim Lane (931)456-2479. Please provide comments on any access issues you
find.<br>
<br>
<br>
The first quarter to half mile is fairly tame just stay to the river left at the islands to avoid
any strainers. The first of these small islands recently had a log at the top forcing you to go
right. Work your way immediately back to the left to get back to the left side of the island.
Avoid the right side of the small island as it leads into a rocky blockage. If you end up there
exit the far right. The left side of this blockage is not advised as it has a 90 degree right
turn that has an undercut in it. The action picks up in the next 3/4 mile with several rapids
with small ledges. At about 1 1/2 miles, you will reach a horizon line as the river makes a left
turn with a rock wall on the river right. This is the most difficult rapid &quot;Compound
Fracture&quot;. You can scout on the island above where the river constricts to form the rapid.
If you do not feel confident, this is a good one to walk! The best portage is on the river right
along the old railroad bed on the rock wall. Some of the rocks in this rapid are from the
creation and demise of the old narrow-gauge railroad on river right and are jagged and spaced to
thwart a clean line. Also be aware of the potential undercut at the bottom on river left;
although I have never seen anyone get in trouble there. The usual run is down the right center
angling right. Several fun rapids are below including &quot;The Slide&quot; and
&quot;Rockhouse&quot;. &quot;Rockhouse&quot; has one of the neatest surfing experiences in the
super large undercut on river left in the semi-dark.&nbsp; There is a new obstacle at the bottom
of Rockhouse rapid.&nbsp; A large rectangular block stone on the river right side at the bottom
creates a pinning potential.&nbsp; The top of the stone is near the water level so look for the
telltale wave.&nbsp; If the water is high enough stay left.&nbsp; If not, your going to have to
squeeze between the pinning block and the large boulder sticking out of the water blocking the
right side.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Near the end of the run there is a large pool with an old RR bridge pier just above an
island.&nbsp;&nbsp;Either side of the island can be run depending on wood that collects
here.&nbsp; This rapid has been changing.&nbsp; I now recommend running the right side of the
island as the left has a potential to push you into an undercut.&nbsp; The right side has a
shallow entrance and less water than the&nbsp;left side but is a fun&nbsp;rapid with a&nbsp;nice
boof/slide&nbsp;drop.&nbsp; Both sides of this island are&nbsp;historically very bad debris traps
and more wood will collect from all the dead wood from pine beetles and weather damage.&nbsp; The
stretch from the last island down to the confluence with the Emory was cleared of strainers in
December 2007 but&nbsp;boaters will need to pay attention for years looking for loose wood and
new wood that can cause strainers.&nbsp; The cut-up logs will push on to the Emory after a big
rain but watch for logs particulary in the last stretch of Island Creek.

We ran Island at 0.9' today. Two of us who have run the creek many times agreedWe ran Island at<br/>
0.9' at 5pm today. Two of us who have run the creek many times agreed that it felt higher than than<br/>
we expected at this flow. But the creek bed is probably very stable at the gauge and it doesn't<br/>
make sense to think that something has changed - it's probably our memory or perception that was<br/>
off. Wood report: most of the run was free of significant strainers except for the last rapid<br/>
that's located just as you exit the 'gorge' at the abandoned bridge pylons. The creek splits around<br/>
a small island and the first two in the group went right. The entrance was clear, but there was a<br/>
river-wide log across the top of the rapid. Another boater ran left of the island, but noticed some<br/>
small trees extending across the creek just below the surface of the water. It's probably best to<br/>
scout here. Gauge correlations: Daddy's had just peaked at 6.7 feet on the USGS gauge a couple of<br/>
hours before we put on. The UGSG CFS readings have been suspected of being off lately - but it read<br/>
3000 CFS at the peak. The Crab Orchard rain gauge received 2.37&quot; and the rain stopped at 6 AM. The<br/>
Wartburg rain gauge got 1.74&quot; with the rain stopping at the same time. There have been a couple of<br/>
huge rain events this winter, but the last two weeks have been pretty dry. </div>

The level today was 0.85 on the first lap and not much lower on the second lap less than an hour<br/>
later. This felt like a good medium-low level where the run felt like a creek but was scrapey in<br/>
only a few places. A sizable rain event came through four days earlier that dropped 1.6&quot; at the<br/>
Crab Orchard rain gage and got Daddy's creek up to 4500 cfs. Today, there was 0.8&quot; at Crab Orchard<br/>
and an even 1&quot; at the Wartburg rain gage. The rain stopped around noon and our first lap was around<br/>
5:30pm. As we neared the put-in, we picked up some boaters that were hitch-hiking back up to their<br/>
car at teh put-in. They said that the level was just under a foot on when they put on so I assume<br/>
it was on its way down when we started our first lap. </div>

Here's a link to a really cool headcam video of the first three-quarters of this run. Compound<br/>
Fracture starts at 7:40 and ends at about 8:00. The paddler takes the left line at the main drop of<br/>
Compound Fracture which is a very runnable line and in my opinion the easier line. However, you'll<br/>
need around 0.8ft or more of water on the bridge gauge. http://www.vimeo.com/11470518 </div>

As of 5/2/2010, the cave rapid is runnable by keeping left throughout the cave. I'm sure some of<br/>
the logs from the slide will move at some point, but the cave rapid is runnable at this time. </div>

Large Strainer at the cave rapid! As of Friday the 22nd there was a rock slide that has blocked the<br/>
entire river and was still falling somewhat when we floated up on it. The ledge is still runnable<br/>
before you get to it though. This was still a great run at 1 ft. You can easily skirt. Pictures to<br/>
be posted </div>

I finally got to experience Island with some real water in it (1.35'), today 3/25/09. All of my<br/>
previous runs had been low (0.4'-0.6'). Two people put-on about an hour before we did and reported<br/>
1.7'. They saw 1.8' before they set shuttle. Now for the correlation with the Crab Orchard rain<br/>
gauge. It has been a pretty good spring in ETN. There had been several good soakings that got many<br/>
plateau runs running, some at high levels. But there had been two weeks with little to no rain<br/>
before we put on Island today. Three quarters of an inch had fallen throughout the day yesterday,<br/>
and then another 3/4 of an inch fell between 4 and 8 am this morning. The 1.8' reading was roughly<br/>
4 pm and the we put on at about 6 pm. The Crab Orchard Rain gauge: http://tinyurl.com/knkot7 </div>

With the expectation of having to hike out, we put on Island Creek this evening (12/11/2008) at 2.9<br/>
feet with only ~45-50 minutes of daylight left. Jim and I climbed into our drysuits and stuffed a<br/>
total of three head lamps into our dry bags. We paddled past the first rapid that usually has a<br/>
slight undercut/sieve hazard if you don't run left. Then came the first slide that harbored a<br/>
couple of big, but managable breaking wave/holes (big relative to normal flows on Island). They<br/>
weren't very alarming, but I knew that a bigger slide was just around the next bend to a left. We<br/>
eddied out on RR and wondered if this is where our expected hike out would begin. We scouted the<br/>
next slide that typically has two drops, but we only saw one drop with a bigger wave/hole in the<br/>
middle. The difficult decision to hike out was then made. If we had had more time/daylight, we<br/>
would have proceded. The view downstream was actually very inviting, but to complete the run before<br/>
dark we knew that we would have very little to no time to scout the bigger drops downstream. I was<br/>
tempted to push on, but my judgement told me that bombing into Compound Fracture and the next<br/>
several drops without scouting would be beyond reckless. If we only had more time! On our way out,<br/>
we crossed side stream dumping into Island on RR and saw a couple of fun class III slides. So we<br/>
hiked up the tiny creek and dropped somewhere around 20 vertical feet in about 30 yards. Then we<br/>
continued our hike to the put-in on the over-grown, abandoned logging road and made it to the car<br/>
just before it got dark enough to necessitate the head lamps. Daddy's was over 6000 csf and<br/>
climbing, Clear Creek at Lily was probably between 4000 and 5000 cfs and rising (the internet graph<br/>
isn't working), and the Emory was just under 20,000 cfs and rising. The Southeast had been in a<br/>
relentless drought, but the Crab Orchard rain gauge showed 3 inches of rain the morning before we<br/>
put on (yesterday) with an additional 2 inches of rain today. What's a little perplexing is that<br/>
people had run Island the day before (after 3 inches of rain) and the level was just under a foot.<br/>
But they did put on around 4 pm - about 11 hours after the rain stopped. During our drive from Oak<br/>
Ridge (via Coalfield and Wartburg), it was raining hard nearly non-stop. I guess that shows how<br/>
fast the levels on Island can rise and drop! I hope to return at 3 feet .... but with more light<br/>
and time! </div>

Ran this at 2 ft on the putin guage on 2/22/03. It is definatly a lot more pushy than at 1 ft. The<br/>
holes are much bigger, and more sticky. There were no strainers that required portaging on our run.<br/>
However, scouting Compound Fracture required several trips across flowing knee deep water. It is<br/>
definatly a good level for the creek, but is pushy, and upgrades most of the rapids a step. Still<br/>
nothing over IV+ in my opinion, but be sure to scout if you have only ran it 1-1.5 feet. There are<br/>
several blind turns that lead to surprisingly strong holes, of which each member of our party spent<br/>
at least a little time in. Who says the Blunt isn't a playboat, you should have seem my linked<br/>
cartwheels! </div>
