<b><a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/archive/article/1159/">Attention Blackwater River
Paddlers</a></b>
</p>
<p>
All Blackwater Paddlers:<br>
The State Park is making it MANDATORY to sign in at the state park lodge. They will be writing
tickets to all kayakers who do not sign in at the state park lodge.<br>
Further considerations are that the community, Tucker County, is considering passing legislation
so that any persons requiring the assistance of S&amp;R response will be responsible for the cost
of the effort. RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COST OF THE S&amp;R EFFORT. The state park reported to me
today that they would have to resort to &quot;drastic actions,&quot; if faced with more fatal
incidents in the future.<br>
<br>
I repeat, it is MANDATORY for all groups kayaking the upper blackwater to sign in at the state
park lodge, just beyond the put-in, on the same road.<br>
The state park is not happy, and they are receiving pressure from local government, S&amp;R, and
other organizations to eliminate access to the canyon.
</p>
<p>
<br>
All paddlers utilizing the Upper Blackwater River in West Virginia should make sure to register
with the <a href="http://www.blackwaterfalls.com/">Blackwater Falls State Park</a> before each
trip into the gorge. Currently boaters should register at the Lodge, however the Park has offered
to place a self-registration facility at the typical put-in for the Upper B (at the Handicap
overlook) in the near future. Please take the few minutes it takes to register so that the Park
has a record of river users and can better respond to emergencies.<br>
In addition, paddlers should alert the Park staff to any situations that they witness or take
part in on the river that could cause concern among park staff or visitors. Examples include
significant accidents, lost boats, injuries, and paddlers hiking out of the gorge. Recently, a
pinned boat was abandoned so that it could be recovered during safer low-water conditions. The
boat was dislodged and was reported to the Park by visitors who saw the upside down boat floating
down the river far below. These reports triggered a needless rescue squad response. Please help
prevent similar situations in the future.<br>
Blackwater Falls State Park is very supportive of whitewater recreationists using the Blackwater
River, and paddlers certainly appreciate it. Let&#39;s show our appreciation by meeting these
very reasonable requests from the park.<br>
If you have any questions, please call Blackwater Falls State Park @ 304-259-5216.<br>

<p>
<strong>The Upper Blackwater is one of the most challenging and dangerous runs in northern West
Virginia.</strong> There are no huge drops but it is constant maneuvering over 2-8-foot ledges
and around big boulders with ugly sieves. The rapids stay consistently difficult the whole way to
the end so be prepared to bring your &quot;A&quot; Game when you venture into the canyon. This
Description will not help you run the river safely. There are far too many rapids to name, or
describe. The only safe way to run the river is with a competent team of experts who know the
river.<br>
<br>
After working your way down the steep trail to the putin, make sure you take a look at the first
rapid, <b>Phil&#39;s</b> or <b>100 Yard Dash</b>. You&#39;ll probably gaze upstream at some point
to see a horrendous looking drop on the river right side called <b>Puke</b>. Here the river falls
off an 8-10-foot ledge into a sieve. The sieve is not quite large to fit the whole flow of the
river, so some water bubbles up and over the sieve rock (which creates an extra 3-foot drop). It
has been run (including by the ZoneDogg) but it is not recommended. At higher flows (over 300
cfs), the river left side of this rapid goes through a very difficult but slightly less heinous
drop than Puke called <b>the Notch</b>. It is runnable but, again, not recommended.<br>
<br>
Back to <b>Phil&#39;s</b>, A 3 part rapid begins with a sloping 6-foot ledge into a roostertail
followed by some shallow stuff slamming into the right wall and pouring off a 3-foot ledge. Most
people catch the 1st eddy on the right at the bottom of the first sloping ledge and ferry out in
front of the wall. This works, except that it is tricky to peel out of the eddy due to a
submerged rock. You can also run it direct down the first ledge on the far right (just to the
right of the roostertail), then drag your left blade once past the rooster to turn left away from
the right wall. The hole at the bottom of the next ledge can get rather stiff as the water goes
up. Either way, you don&#39;t want to go straight down the middle of the first drop and piton.
From here, Phil&#39;s continues over a juicy diagonal 4-foot ledge that is boofed left or far
right into a swirly eddy Immediately it narrows and goes through a narrow drop that is best run
left of center with right angle to avoid an undercut on the left.
</p>
<p>
If this doesn&#39;t look fun to you, put your boat on your shoulder and hike back up to the
parking lot because this is one of the best rapids on the run, and fairly representative of the
difficulties to come. The next 50 yards are fast and technical with small ledges and moves
leading into the <b>Upper Blackwater Rodeo Hole</b>. This hole is at the very bottom of the rapid
and would probably be a great hole in a rodeo boat (it can get a creek boat vertical). It is
kinda sticky and there are lots of tough drops still to come in the next 2.5 miles, so play with
caution.<br>
<br>
The river widens out below here and I run a small channel on extreme river left that contains
some small drops. For the next quarter-half mile the run goes through delightful ledges and
boulder drops that are mostly boat-scoutable, (beware of trees) and finishes with &quot;The
<strong>Bowling Alley</strong>&quot;<br>
Soon, you will reach <b>Z Falls</b>, which is recognized by a good horizon line and a
triangle-shaped rock with a pillow on it in the middle of the river. Go to the left of the
triangle rock and boof off a 6-8-foot ledge. After landing, I zig zag around some small drops
with grabby holes. There is a good boof in the next part but generally your looking for green
tongues. The rapids remain steep with lots of cool boofs and slots for the next 1/4 mile.
</p>
<p>
After a particularly fun rapid that requires dodging offset holes comes
<strong>Goldilocks</strong>. This rapid kinda resembles Pincushion on the Green Narrows. A 1-foot
ledge leads into a junky drop. The move is to boof and turn your boat 90 degrees to the left in
the air, then immediately angle back to the right to avoid Chopper&#39;s undercut. When you see a
sizeable horizon line around&nbsp; the next , you will know that you have reached <b>Tomko
Falls</b>, which marks the start of the steepest and hardest stretch of the Upper B (Oh
Yes!).<br>
<br>
<strong>Tomko</strong> is the steepest rapid on the Upper Blackwater and definitely one of the
most fun. It is broken into two parts. The top ledge can be run right or left of center. The most
common line is to boof off the top 8-foot ledge on the right and then catch a big eddy on the
right. You can also boof the left side of this drop and go right, or the direct line through a
slot on the extreme left&nbsp; but this tends to filter you towards an inconveniently placed
boulder right above the second drop.<br>
<br>
From the eddy on river right, paddle upstream and ferry out in front of the inconvenient boulder
and into a micro eddy on the left. The second part of this rapid is another 8-foot boof located
left of center. From the micro eddy I head downstream with right angle towards the boof and, at
the last second, take a wicked boof stroke to get a SIK launch. As you fall, there will be spray
flying up underneath you, but I have never landed on any rock coming off this boof so I don&#39;t
worry about the spray. A junky runout drop carries you into an eddy on the left. If you miss the
eddy.... keep boofing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
At higher levels; there is also a Center line (the big splat line) that can be done with hard
left angle to avoid catastrophe,&nbsp; and also a narrow slot move out of the the far right eddy
that collects wood.<br>
<br>
After a twisty slope into a hole, you reach <b>Shock to the System</b>. Here, the river necks
down and pours over a slope into a 4-5-foot ledge with a vicious hole at the bottom. At lower
flows (below 250 cfs), you can go right down the middle and punch/jump the hole. As the run gets
higher, you may pay a severe penalty if you attempt to punch the hole. At most flows, the best
idea is to start in the river right eddy and run middle to left pointed to the left, boofing the
left side of the hole with a right stroke. This is a tricky move to do correctly but it will
prevent a nasty beatdown in the hole, which you should not swim out of, as the pool moves quickly
into the next rapid.
</p>
<p>
Now you&#39;ve reached <b>Sticky Fingers</b>, one of the most dangerous rapids on the river.
Below Shock, run the sloping ledge on the right into an eddy and get out on the right and have a
look. Most paddlers walk this rapid and with good reason. This was the location of the first
fatality on the Upper B. The absolute worst thing you could do is to drop through the slot in the
center right next to the big triangle rock. This is called &quot;A Matter of Time&quot;. It spits
you out above a huge sieve than can swallow a boat and paddler whole. If you decide to run the
rapid, the best line is to ferry out to an eddy agains the left bank. From here, peel out and
punch an irregular shaped hole, being sure not to get pushed right. You run off a small narrow
slot in the center next to a large toilet bowl sieve. The far left is also pretty junky, but its
better than the alternative. This is a very scary rapid! An easy way to sneak at decent flow is
to gorilla walk yourself through the far river right slot at the top of the rapid with a little
bit of left angle, then drop your bow sharply to the right. You will land right next to the
outflow of the seive. Or, portage on the right.<br>
<br>
The next rapid, <strong>Pinball</strong>, is a steep, trashy rock pile. Its a good idea to scout
it while you are portaging Sticky Fingers. Sitting in the river right eddy below Sticky Fingers,
You are just upstream of a giant sieved out ledge on river right. You don&#39;t want to go here.
The simplest way to run this rapid is to ferry over and run far left and stay all the way left
through the slots. Avoid any temptation to take any of the chutes in the middle (they are rather
pinny). However some paddlers avoid the pinball slots by catching a micro&nbsp; eddy on river
left and ferrying over to the right in front of a nasty looking pin rock. you will come out below
the aforementioned sieve. Done well - this is the cleanest line and it drops you in an
eddy.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Immediately and with no break, there is another horizon line. This can be run down a double drop
on the left or a 5 foot boof in the center. Now&nbsp; the river pools up behind a pile of
boulders. This is <strong>Angle Left or Piton</strong>, or <strong>Kerplunge</strong>.&nbsp;
Here, the river narrows and drops off a sloped 6-foot ledge into a stiff hole next to an
overhanging boulder. At higher water (over 400), there is a sneak on the far right through a very
narrow slot. Take this if you have any doubts, it sets you up for a safe approach to
<strong>Flatliner</strong>. Or, you can portage both drops on the left. The Main line is to get
in the main current, angle slightly left of the giant square boulder and take a strong late boof
down the sloper. This should launch you out clear of the hole. If your too far left at the top
you will scrape over a shelf lose your speed.&nbsp; Too far right is really bad because the
boulder overhangs the hole.&nbsp; If you blow it, you might get backendered or surfed but do not
swim. there are some funky boils in the run out. work your way over to the big eddy on river
right.<br>
<br>
The river winds to the right quickly through some small holes that lead to <b>Flatliner
Falls</b>. Two paddlers have died here 18 months apart. This is a simple ledge that should be run
in the center, not on the left. Most of the water is channelized towards a seam on the left,
where it falls onto a shallow clam shell pin rock under the ledge. there have been numerous close
calls here and 2 fatalities, despite the fact that this is the most notorious pin spot on the
river. Starting from the river right eddy is probably best. Stay in the center, on top of the
thin current flowing over the smooth slab. point straight downstream.&nbsp; Go off the tip of the
center of the convex shaped ledge. There will be a square boulder on the right next to where you
should land.<br>

After some more fun boulder drops, Shay&#39;s Run enters on the left. the river widens out and
you reach a stretch called <b>No Man&#39;s Land</b>. For the next 3/4 mile the river alternates
between wide shallow stretches of&nbsp; fun mank and more steep, challenging boulder drops. A lot
of the boulder drops are very fun and complex but beware some can sneak up on you. Pendleton Run
comes in on the right, coming off the mountain in a beautiful cascade.
</p>
<p>
A&nbsp; rapid of note in this section soon after Pendleton is the <strong>Hanging
Gardens</strong> or &#39;U-turn&#39;. there is a big pool on the left and a big cliff visible
downstream on river right. The line is to go just right of a pillow at the top, then eddy out
behind a large boulder and use it to ferry over to river right. Punch the hole to avoid the
undercut on the right at the bottom.&nbsp; At higher levels or if there&#39;s wood you can run
straight down the right the whole way. The next rapid is the classic <strong>Mogul
Field</strong>.&nbsp; It starts off with a sweet 5-foot boof, then a series of offset pillows and
shelves. After that is &quot;<strong>Right Left Right</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Little
West Prong</strong>&quot;<br>
<br>
As you near the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River/detail/id/3213/">North
Fork</a> (you will be able to see the cut in the mountain where the North Fork comes in), you
will come to a large congested boulder garden. This is &quot;<strong>Maze</strong>&quot; but
Blackwater Don Smith called this rapid <strong>Mumina Humida.</strong>. Wood is often a problem
here but the safe line is to enter through the hallway on river left, stay straight and scrape
off a shallow drop and then head over to an eddy river right. Picking the correct channel is
crucial, as there are a lot of ugly spots here.&nbsp; The river funnels down a little chute into
another boulder garden. The right side lands on a sieve rockpile, but there are sweet boofs in
the center and down the left. These drop you onto a long, shallow, bunmpy but fun slide that used
to have a big boulder sitting midstream that has rolled away.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
It is at this point that you confront <b>My Nerves Are Shot And I Can&#39;t Take It Anymore</b>!
This is a long series of bedrock slides starting with the infamous rapid
<strong>Turncoat</strong>. There is also a sneak channel on far river left for those who
don&#39;t like having to make tough choices. If you stay in the main channel you should catch an
eddy on river right. Turncoat appears as a horizon line broken up by boulders. the far far right
tunnel slot has been run but it attracts wood. the Center-right line is dangerous because much of
the water falls into a pothole seive in the center. The popular line- <strong>Bungee
Jump</strong> is to ferry over to the far left and boof into a shallow pool then catch your
breath for the rest of &quot;<strong>Nerves</strong>.&quot;<br>
<br>
The first slide of Nerves is simple and straightforward but this leads directly into the second
slide which is the crux. This slide is steeper than the first with diagonals pushing to the left.
much of the water falls off the left side of the shelf about halfway down. You don&#39;t want to
drop off to the left too early because you fall into a seam. You don&#39;t want to paddle
straight off the end of the shelf because this will land you into a really nasty hole against the
right wall. Try to be aware of where you are in the rapid, find the 2nd and 3rd diagonals that
drop off the far corner of the shelf and hit the sweet spot, skipping into the eddy.<br>
<br>
The third slide looks Intimidating, but its a smooth slope into a hole. The right side of it
slams into an undercut cliff on the right that is nasty but mostly out of play unless you are
swimming. Most people run down the center, riding the huge pillow coming off the cliff. It can
also be snuck on the far left. Immediately below- head left and line up a sweet 6 foot boof that
is Drop #4 of Nerves. This can be run down a slope in the center too. The 5th part is a simple
slide that can be run anywhere. At high water these ledges form huge holes, some can be snuck or
portaged on the left.<br>
<br>
After a big pool, you reach a junky drop.&nbsp; Avoid the temptation to hit a boof at the top of
this rapid on the right. There is a horrible sieve on the right side waiting below you if you
blow it and some ugly rocks all around. Run left of center down a jumble, or make an S-turn from
center to left. Afterwards, there is one more noteworthy rapid before the takeout. The right line
is fairly simple and leads up to a junky 4 foot boof. The left line requires you to punch a hole
and angle right to avoid a big sieve on the left bank. Below there is a simple ledge. Within
sight of the take out is another junky drop where there historically was a rapid called
<strong>Tightness</strong> just before the confluence. Instead, you will see an ugly truck-sized
boulder perched midstream, reminding you of the shifty nature of this riverbed.<br>
<br>
Yuck! Well, that concludes the Upper Blackwater. Eddy out right at the North Fork, hike out and
run the Upper again, or continue on down the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River/detail/id/2335/">Lower B</a> to Hendricks.<br>
<br>
<b>Shuttle:</b> Take Rte. 32 towards Davis. Turn at the Exxon station (there will be signs for
Blackwater Falls State Park). Follow it back for a mile or so until you reach a &quot;Y&quot; in
the road. Make a left at the &quot;Y&quot; and cross the Blackwater. Shortly after, there will be
an overlook parking lot on your right where the put in trail starts, but the lodge (please sign
in) is furthur down the road. You will be able to hear the roar of the river from here. Follow
the trail down the side of the canyon until you reach the river. This is the putin. The takeout
can be in Hendricks (the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River_detail_id_2335_">Lower B</a> takeout) or at the
confluence with the <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River_detail_id_3213_">North Fork</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>Levels:</b> The gauge is very convenient for this run, being the Davis gauge just upstream of
Blackwater Falls. Generally, the Upper Blackwater is run most between 250 cfs and 325 cfs.
However, the Upper B is enjoyable on down below 200 cfs. I like to see 150 cfs or higher before
I&#39;ll drive out (I have done it as low as 80 cfs, very scrapy). Between 150-250 cfs, the river
is not pushy and is channelized enough that there is not a lot of scraping. This is a great level
to see the run at for your first time. As the water progresses over 300 cfs, there is more
padding but also a lot of power. Nasty holes begin to develop and the distance between rapids
shrinks. Once it reaches 400, most paddlers will want to head elsewhere. My personal cutoff is at
500 cfs. Of course, there are guys that run it at higher levels than I do--and I wish them the
best of luck.

</div>
</div> 
<p>
After working your way down the steep trail to the putin, make sure you take a look at the first rapid, <b>Phil&#39;s</b> or <b>100 Yard Dash</b>. You&#39;ll probably gaze upstream at some point to see a horrendous looking drop on the river right side called <b>Puke</b>. Here the river falls off an 8-10-foot ledge into a sieve. The sieve is not quite large to fit the whole flow of the river, so some water bubbles up and over the sieve rock (which creates an extra 3-foot drop). It has been run (including by the ZoneDogg) but it is not recommended. At higher flows (over 300 cfs), the river left side of this rapid goes through a very difficult but slightly less heinous drop than Puke called <b>the Notch</b>. It is runnable but, again, not recommended.<br/>
<br/>
Back to <b>Phil&#39;s</b>, it begins with a sloping 6-foot ledge into a roostertail followed by some shallow stuff slamming into the right wall and pouring off a 3-foot ledge. Most people catch the 1st eddy on the right at the bottom of the first sloping ledge and ferry out in front of the wall. This works, except that it is difficult to peel out of the eddy due to a submerged rock. You could also head straight down the first ledge on the far right (just to the right of the roostertail), then drag your left blade once past the rooster to turn left away from the right wall.&nbsp; The hole at the bottom of the next ledge can get rather stiff as the water goes up.&nbsp; Either way, you don&#39;t want to go straight down the middle of the first drop and piton into the roostertail. If this dosen&#39;t look fun to you, put your boat on your shoulder and hike back up to the parking lot because this is one of the cleanest rapids on the run<br/>
<br/>
From here, Phil&#39;s continues over a juicy 4-foot ledge that is boofed on the left or right. the approach to this rapid changed in 2010.&nbsp; Then, it narrows and goes over a narrow drop that is best run left of center with right angle to avoid an undercut on the left. The next 50 yards are fast and technical with small ledges and moves leading into the <b>Upper Blackwater Rodeo Hole</b>. This hole is at the very bottom of the rapid and would probably be a great hole in a rodeo boat (it can get a creek boat vertical). It is kinda sticky and there are lots of tough drops still to come in the next 2.5 miles, so play with caution.</p>

<p>
The river widens out below here and I run a small channel on extreme river left that contains some small drops. For the next quarter-half mile the run goes through delightful boulder patches that are all boat-scoutable.<br/>
Soon, you will reach <b>Z Falls</b>, which is recognized by a good horizon line and a triangle-shaped rock with a pillow on it in the middle of the river. Go to the left of the triangle rock and boof off a 6-8-foot ledge. After landing, I zig zag over some small drops with right angle and pillow off the left wall. There is a good boof on the left in the next part and a good boof left of center in the final drop of the rapid.</p>

</div>
</div> 
<p>
After a small pool, you want to stay to the right through some shallow stuff. At the bottom of this shallow stretch lies <b>SIK Slot</b>. It is on the right side of the river. You run between a boulder on the right and a fan rock a few feet to the left of the boulder. I drag my left blade as I go through the slot and over a 4-5-foot ledge to prevent my paddle from hitting the boulder. Very cool.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately after SIK Slot, there is a really cool boof on the right. The rapids remain steep with lots of cool boofs and slots for the next 1/4 mile.</p>

<p>
After a particularly fun rapid that requires dodging offset holes comes <strong>Goldilocks</strong>. this rapid resembles Pin Cushin on the Green Narrows. a 1 foot ledge leads into a junky drop. the move is to boof and turn your boat 90 degrees to the left, then immediately angle back to the right to avoid Chopper&#39;s undercut .</p>

</div>
</div> 
<p>
When you see a sizeable horizon line, you will know that you have reached <b>Tomko Falls</b>, which marks the start of the steepest and hardest stretch of the Upper B (Oh Yesh!).<br/>
<br/>
Tomko is the steepest rapid on the Upper Blackwater and definitely one of the most fun. It is broken into two parts. The top part can be run a number of ways. The most common line is to boof off the top 8-foot ledge on the right and run a few smaller drops into an eddy on the right. You can also boof the left side of this drop or run a series of drops in a slot on the extreme left but these tend to filter you towards an inconveniently placed boulder right above the second part.<br/>
<br/>
From the eddy on the right, ferry out in front of the inconvenient boulder and into an eddy on the left. The second part of this rapid is another 8-foot boof located left of center. I head sideways with right angle towards the boof and, at the last second, take a wicked bitchslap of a boof stroke to get a SIK launch. As you fall, there will be spray flying up underneath you, hinting at the possibility of there being a rock that you will land on. I have never landed on any rock coming off this boof so I don&#39;t worry about the spray. A junky runout drop carries you into an eddy on the left. At higher levels there is also a Center line (the big splat line) that can be done with hard left angle to avoid catastrophe. there is also a narrow slot move on the far right.</p>
<br>
<br clear=right>
</div><div id='zzq1ibusse9um72RiverRapidView73' class='CRiverRapidView-view CRiverRapidView'> <b><a name="rapid6157">Shock to the System</a></b> (Class V, Mile 1.0)<br>
<p>
After a twisty slope into a hole, you reach <b>Shock to the System</b>. Here, the river necks down and pours over a slope into a 4-5-foot ledge with a vicious hole at the bottom. At lower flows (below 250 cfs), you can go right down the middle and punch/jump the hole. As the run gets higher, you may pay a severe penalty if you attempt to punch the hole. At higher flows, the best idea is to start in the river right eddy and then angle hard across the drop to the left, boofing the left side of the hole. This is a very tricky move to do correctly but, if nailed, it will prevent a nasty surf in the hole, which you should not swim out of.</p>
<br>
<br clear=right>
</div><div id='zzq1ibusse9um72RiverRapidView74' class='CRiverRapidView-view CRiverRapidView'> <b><a name="rapid6158">Sticky Fingers</a></b> (Class 5.1, Mile 1.1)<br>
<p>
After a fast pool and a small sloping ledge, you reach <b>Sticky Fingers</b>, one of the most dangerous rapids on the run. Get out on the right and have a look. Most paddlers walk this rapid and with good reason. This was the location of the first fatality on the Upper B. The absolute worst thing you could do is to drop through the&nbsp; slot right next to the&nbsp; big triangle rock in the Center that used to be called &quot;A Matter of Time&quot;. It spits you out above a huge seive than can swallow a boat and paddler whole.&nbsp; If you decide to run the rapid, the best line is to ferry out to an eddy agains the left bank. From here, peel out and punch an irregular shaped hole, being sure not to get pushed too far right.&nbsp; You run off a small narrow drop in the center next to a large toilet bowl sieve. the far left is pretty junky too. This is a very scary rapid! An easy way to sneak at decent flow is to gorilla walk yourself through the far river right slot at the top of the rapid with a little bit of left angle, then drop your bow sharply to the right. You will land right next to the outflow of the seive. portage on the right.</p>
<br>
<br clear=right>
</div><div id='zzq1ibusse9um72RiverRapidView75' class='CRiverRapidView-view CRiverRapidView'> <b><a name="rapid6159">Pinball</a></b> (Class V, Mile 1.2)<br>
<p>
The next rapid, <strong>Pinball</strong>, is a steep, trashy rock pile. Half of the flow goes far right and drops off into a sieve. You don&#39;t want to go here. The best way to run this rapid is to run far left and stay all the way left until the last chute that falls off to the right. Avoid any temptation to take any of the chutes that drop off to the right early (they are rather pinny). However some paddlers avoid the pinball slots by catching an eddy on river left and ferrying over to the right in front of a nasty looking pin rock. Done well - this is the cleanest line and it drops you in an eddy. Sound confusing? Scout it while you are portaging Sticky Fingers.&nbsp; Immediately and with no break, there is another horizon line. This can be run down a double drop on the left or a 5 foot boof in the center.</p>
<br>
<br clear=right>
</div><div id='zzq1ibusse9um72RiverRapidView76' class='CRiverRapidView-view CRiverRapidView'> <b><a name="rapid6160">Angle Left or Piton</a></b> (Class 5.1, Mile 1.3)<br>
<p>
Immediately after, the river pools up behind a pile of boulders. This is <strong>Angle Left or Piton</strong>. Here, the river drops off a sloped 6-foot ledge into a stiff hole under an overhanging boulder. At higher water (over 300), there is a sneak on the far right through a very narrow slot. Take this if you have any doubts, it sets you up for a safe approach to Flatliner. Or, you can portage both drops on the left. The Main line is start on river right, get in the main current, angle slightly left and take a strong late boof on the sloper. This should launch you out clear of the hole. If your too far left at the top you will scrape over a shelf lose your speed.&nbsp; Too far right is really bad because a large boulder overhangs the hole.&nbsp; If you blow it, you might get backendered or surfed. there are some funky boils in the run out. work your way over to the big eddy on river right.</p>

<p>
The river winds to the right quickly through some small holes that lead to <b>Flatliner Falls</b>. Two paddlers have died here 18 months apart. This is a simple 4 foot ledge that should be run in the center. Not on the left.&nbsp; Much of the water is channelized on the left, where it falls onto a shallow pin&nbsp; rock under the ledge. There have been numerous close calls here and 2 fatalities, despite the fact that this is the most notorious pin spot on the river. Starting from the river right eddy is probably best. Stay in the center, on top of the thin current flowing over the smooth slab. Go off the tip of the center of the convex shaped ledge. Most of the water is falling off to the left--to a deadly undercut. <strong>Don&#39;t be on the left. </strong>There will be a square boulder on the bottom right next to where you should land. Don&#39;t go left!!!<br/>

<p>
After some more fun boulder drops,&nbsp; Shay&#39;s run enters on the left. the river widens out and you are in a stretch called <b>No Man&#39;s Land</b>. For the next 3/4 mile the river alternates between wide shallow stretches and more steep, challenging boulder drops. A lot of the boulder drops are&nbsp; fun and complex,&nbsp; . Pendleton Run comes in on the right, coming off the mountain in a beautiful cascade.</p>

<p>
A&nbsp; rapid of note in this section soon after Pendleton is the <strong>Hanging Gardens</strong> or &#39;U-turn&#39;. there is a big pool on the left and a big cliff visible downstream on river right. the line is to go just right of a pillow at the top, then eddy out behind a large boulder and use it to ferry over to river right. Punch the hole to avoid the undercut on the right at the bottom.&nbsp; At higher levels you can run straight down the right. The next rapid is the classic <strong>Mogul Field</strong>.&nbsp; It starts off with a sweet 5-foot boof, then a series of offset pillows and shelves.</p>

<p>
As you near the North Fork (you will be able to see the cut in the mountain where the North Fork comes in), you will come to a large congested boulder garden. This is &quot;<strong>Maze</strong>&quot; or, the <strong>Slots</strong>. wood is often a problem here but the safe line is to enter through the hallway on river left, stay straight and scrape off a shallow drop and turn right. The river funnels down a fun little chute into another boulder garden. Blackwater Don Smith called this rapid <strong>Mumina Humida.</strong> The right side lands on a rockpile, but there are sweet boofs in the center and down the left. These drop you onto a long, shallow, but fun slide that used to have a big boulder sitting midstream that has rolled away.</p>

<p>
It is at this point that you confront <b>My Nerves Are Shot And I Can&#39;t Take It Anymore</b>! This is a long series of bedrock slides starting with the infamous rapid <strong>Turncoat</strong>.&nbsp; There is also a sneak on far river left for those who don&#39;t like having to make tough choices. If you stay in the main channel you should catch an eddy on river right. Turncoat appears as a horizon line broken up by boulders. the far far right tunnel slot has been run but it attracts wood. the Center-right line is dangerous because much of the water falls into a pothole seive left of center. The popular line- <strong>Bungee Jump</strong> is to ferry accross to the far&nbsp; left and boof into a shallow pool then catch your breath for the rest of &quot;<strong>Nerves</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>
After Turncoat the paddler gets a special treat. The first slide of Nerves is simple and straightforward but this leads right into the second slide. This slide is steeper than the first with diagonals pushing to the left. much of the water falls off the left side of the shelf about halfway down. You don&#39;t want to drop off to the left too early because this will put you into a crease. You don&#39;t want to paddle straight off the end of the shelf because this will land you into a nasty hole against the right wall.&nbsp; Try to be aware of where you are in the rapid, find the 2nd, and 3rd diagonal that drops off the far corner of the shelf and hit the sweet spot.<br/>
<br/>
The third slide is a smooth slope into a hole. The right side of it slams into an undercut cliff on the right that is intimidating but mostly out of play unless you are swimming. Most people run down center-right, riding the huge pillow coming off the cliff. Immediately head left and run off a sweet 5-6 boof that is drop #4 of Nerves. This drop can be run down a slope in the center too. The 5th part is a simple slide that can be run anywhere. At high water these ledges form huge holes, some can be snuck or portaged on the left.</p>

<p>
After a big pool, you reach a junky drop.&nbsp; Avoid the temptation to hit a boof at the top of this rapid on the right. There is a horrible sieve on the right side waiting below you if you blow it and some ugly rocks all around the boof rock. Run left of center down a jumble, or make an S-turn from center to left. Afterwards, there is one more noteworthy rapid before the take out. the right line is fairly simple and leads up to a junky 4 foot boof. The left line requires you to punch a hole and angle right to avoid a big sieve on the left bank. afterwards is another junky drop where there historically was a rapid called <strong>Tightness</strong> just before the confluence. Instead, you will see an ugly truck sized boulder perched midstream reminding you of the shifty nature of this riverbed<br/>
<br/>
Yuck! well that concludes the Upper Blackwater. Eddy out right at the North Fork,&nbsp; hike out and run the Upper again, or continue on down the Lower B to Hendricks.</p>

Please not that there are several class V rapids on the Upper Blackwater. Rapids that I consider to<br/>
be Class V include: 100 Yard Dash, Z Falls, Tomko Falls, Sticky Fingers, and My Nerves Are Shot.<br/>
There are also other &quot;easier&quot; rapids such as Shock to the System and Pinball that would be<br/>
considered Class V on most other rivers. There are also many unnamed rapids on the Blackwater that<br/>
become Class V at certain water levels. And keep in mind that even the &quot;easy&quot; rapids have hidden<br/>
consequences. </div>

Do not run far left at Flatliner Falls! Flatliner Falls is fairly easy compared to the other rapids<br/>
on the Upper Blackwater, but the entrance can be tricky if you don't know where you're going and<br/>
the rapid above Flatliner can flip you or backender you. Flatliner Falls has now been the site of 2<br/>
fatalities and reportedly many other pins and close calls. Also, keep in mind that Flatliner Falls<br/>
looks relatively benign compared to many of the other rapids on the Blackwater. If it can be so<br/>
deadly, all of the other rapids can as well. Please keep in mind that the Lower Blackwater has also<br/>
claimed lives and has a stream bed that changes often. This is one of my favorite rivers and I take<br/>
it very seriously, as should everyone else. Please make good decisions and do not ever let your<br/>
guard down when kayaking the Blackwater Canyon. Be safe and have fun out there. You can see some<br/>
low water photos of Flatliner Falls courtesy of JB Seay's blog:<br/>

Attention Upper Blackwater Paddlers New<br/>
<br/>
Forum: BoaterTalk<br/>
Date: May 24 2004, 19:25 GMT<br/>
From: wu_wei<br/>
<br/>
All paddlers utilizing the Upper Blackwater River in West Virginia should make sure to register<br/>
with the Blackwater Falls State Park before each trip into the gorge. Currently boaters should<br/>
register at the Lodge, however the Park has offered to place a self-registration facility at the<br/>
typical put-in for the Upper B (at the Handicap overlook) in the near future. Please take the few<br/>
minutes it takes to register so that the Park has a record of river users and can better respond to<br/>
emergencies.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, paddlers should alert the Park staff to any situations that they witness or take part<br/>
in on the river that could cause concern among park staff or visitors. Examples include significant<br/>
accidents, lost boats, injuries, and paddlers hiking out of the gorge. Recently, a pinned boat was<br/>
abandoned so that it could be recovered during safer low-water conditions. The boat was dislodged<br/>
and was reported to the Park by visitors who saw the upside down boat floating down the river far<br/>
below. These reports triggered a needless rescue squad response. Please help prevent similar<br/>
situations in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Blackwater Falls State Park is very supportive of whitewater recreationists using the Blackwater<br/>
River, and paddlers certainly appreciate it. Lets show our appreciation by meeting these very<br/>
reasonable requests from the park.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, please call Mike Moore @ 304-283-7792<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Kevin Colburn, AW<br/>

Important. Upper Blackwater Boaters Read This!!! Avoid access problems in park!<br/>
Date: May 24 2004, Posted to Boater Talk<br/>
From: bobgedekoh<br/>
<br/>
Recently a kayak was left pinned in a rapid on the Upper Blackwater. The boater apparently walked<br/>
out... uninjured. (I dont know any of the specific details of this.)<br/>
<br/>
Apparently the kayak was spotted by the park staff from Pendleton Point (possibly several days<br/>
later). They park authorities became concerned and sent staff into the gorge to retrieve the boat<br/>
and make sure that no one was in trouble. Because the river gorge is so deep and difficult to<br/>
access, this was a major undertaking.<br/>
<br/>
One of the head rangers at the park is reportedly fairly unhappy about this situation. Apparently<br/>
the issue was that no one had stopped at the park office and told them what was going on. Had they<br/>
known that everyone was okay,they would have been spared a lot of work and worry.<br/>
<br/>
As you all know the only way to access the Upper Blackwater is through the park. With that in mind,<br/>
if you walk off the river and leave anything behind that might raise a concern, please notify the<br/>
park authorities.<br/>
<br/>
The staff at the park have been very accomodating over the years and we need to cooperate with them<br/>
fully to keep the river open to kayaking.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, I do not know the specifics of this incident and I am not pointing any fingers. Just<br/>
asking everyone to do their best to maintain good relations with the State Park staff. SYOTR. </div>
