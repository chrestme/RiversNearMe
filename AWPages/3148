<h3>
TSHLETSHY CREEK: THE BEST WHITEWATER IN WASHINGTON?
</h3>
<h3>
by Gary Korb
</h3>
<p>
<i>A guidebook author and his buddy launch a three day, class V expedition through the wilds of
the Olympic Peninsula.</i>
</p>
<p>
Hanging from my perch 80 feet above the river, I was thinking we could have run the class VI
canyon with less risk than we were taking on these crumbly gorge walls. And I was facing my own
worst nightmare---a flooded class VI canyon with no apparent portage.
</p>
<p>
This whole nerve-wracking trip had started two years earlier when I had seen slides from Scott
Matthew's and Sprague Ackley's exploratory trip. "The best whitewater in Washington," they
claimed. I was seduced by shots of spectacular ledge drops in amazing gorges.
</p>
<p>
Scott sent me some notes from his trip:
</p>
<pre>
Tshletshy Creek
Class   IV-V    logged at 150-200 cfs
Length 12.8 miles + 7 miles on Queets River Gradient 143 feet/mile ( 50 
to 340 )
Time required 3 to 4 days
1 day to hike in (11 miles)
2 days to boat the river (20 hours)
Number of rapids        Class III       104
Class IV        67
Class V 20
Class VI to unrunnable 10
</pre>
<p>
I showed this to my buddy Mike Deckert and we were off. Tshletshy Creek is a tributary to the
Queets River on the west side of Washington's Olympic Peninsula. Not only is Tshletshy hard to
say and spell, it's even more difficult to access. There are no roads anywhere near this
watershed, which lies within Olympic National Park-an untouched temperate rain forest. The
world's largest Douglas Fir and Alaska Cedar are attractions along the trip.
</p>
<p>
First we hiked the empty kayaks seven miles and 3100 vertical feet to the divide separating
Tshletshy from the Quinault. It was April and the snow made sliding the boats through the upper
meadows very easy.
</p>
<p>
Two weeks later we returned with three day's worth of self support gear and we headed for "the
best whitewater in the state." When we reached the boats we loaded some gear in them and carried
the rest in packs. Once we started into the Tshletshy drainage, the trail went from bad to
non-existent. After traversing several blowdowns and avalanche chutes we were exhausted zombies.
We sat and rested, staring at the headwaters of the creek. Small chutes of snow fed several tiny
tribs. We scrambled down about a half mile and reached the creek; it was about 15 cfs!
</p>
<p>
We stared in stunned disappointment, wondering how far we would have to walk before there would
be enough volume to paddle. We were so exhausted we made camp, just as the rain began. No
surprise in one of the wettest valleys in the U.S. We each had small tarps and soon we were
resting comfortably and cooking ramen on Mike's stove. We joked about waking up in the morning
with ample water to paddle. Soon I was asleep on my bed of moss.
</p>
<p>
The next morning we discovered our dreams had come true. About 75 cfs of rusty brown water was
flowing past our camp. An amazing flow, considering the drainage area was only about 4 square
miles!
</p>
<p>
We put on and after a half mile we came to the first gorge. Scouting revealed 100 feet of drop
over five falls. An easy portage on river left put that gorge behind us.
</p>
<p>
At the second gorge we scouted a big rapid that went around a turn to the right. I walked down
and scouted the turn; there was a clear route along the left wall. Looking down from above, I
didn't realize that it dropped about ten feet. I told Mike it was okay along the left and headed
down. I eddied out just in time to see Mike's eyes bulging as he flew around the corner and
plunged over the drop.
</p>
<p>
We were starting to have some real fun. Just below the second gorge we spotted a huge bull elk
whose antlers were adorned in rich velvet.
</p>
<p>
Another mile brought us to the "Tshlasm." This is the third gorge, which drops about 150 feet in
several falls. Another easy portage on the left and we were back in our boats, making good time
through endless class III - V drops. The water level was now about 500 cfs and the creek was
starting to have a real punch.
</p>
<p>
By afternoon several close calls had left us tired and scared. The water level was at least 750
cfs and the holes were becoming a real terror. At one point we braved a trashy boulder-choked
mess on the left, just to avoid a small falls with a benign hole on the right.
</p>
<p>
Our judgment was warped. We needed to find a camp, but we hadn't seen anything but gorges for
hours. Then, there it was, a perfect spot. This turned out to be the only campsite in six miles
of demanding canyon. At lower water levels it would take quite a push to get there in one day.
</p>
<p>
We set up while the rain continued to fall. As we sat cooking our dinner, knowing that the river
would continue to rise, I was terrified, thinking, "You got yourself into this mess and now
you're going to have to get yourself out."
</p>
<p>
The next morning the river was huge. Brown exploding waves carried debris speeding off around the
corner. We estimated the flow to be about 1800 cfs. As we ate breakfast we talked about laying
over a day or so, but decided if we didn't show up on schedule, our wives might initiate a
rescue.
</p>
<p>
We put on and blasted the first mile of brown raceway, only stopping to scout one giant rapid
ending in a huge hole. We stopped to scout a class IV drop that slammed into and under a logjam
with amazing force. I wanted to portage, but the cliffs were vertical or worse. There was one
place to go under the logs on the right, but the current was moving to the left.
</p>
<p>
As I got into my boat I felt I was taking a big chance. My fear made the rapid seem class VI. One
missed stroke and I'd face my demise. I watched Mike hit a few holes and pull right safely. This
gave me more confidence, and I made the move easily.
</p>
<p>
But after ducking under the trees, I saw Mike scrambling along the left, trying to get into an
eddy. I pulled into the slow water on the right and started treading water along the wall. Mike
could get out of his boat but he couldn't see much. He signaled the right looked better.
</p>
<p>
It didn't matter; I couldn't tread water any longer, so I headed down the right side. Bumbling
through the class V drop that followed seemed anti-climactic after all our close calls.
</p>
<p>
We burned off another mile of great water, even stopping at several playspots, easing our anxiety
a bit. Then we came to a narrow gorge with a severe horizon. Scouting revealed a ten foot falls
ramping into a violent flush around a blind turn. Smooth high walls kept us from seeing much
around the corner, but there appeared to be another significant falls ahead. I couldn't even
think of running these drops.
</p>
<p>
A small crumbly gully headed up on the right, so up we went. After a horrendous workout roping
loaded boats up the cliffs, we dead ended about twenty feet from the top. We were so exhausted we
just sat, supported by a Yew tree that was threatening to tear loose from the fragile walls.
</p>
<p>
Mike decided to go back down and attempt another route. We hoped he would be able to lower a rope
from above. Hanging from this perch, I was thinking it would have been easier to flush over the
falls, as compared to crawling along those cliffs, tooth and nail. After about twenty minutes I
heard Mike yelling from above.
</p>
<p>
He lowered the rope and pulled the boats up. His route had been exposed and scary, so I decided
to use the rope for the last pitch also. With nothing but flaky rock to climb on, I went hand
over hand. But about 3/4 of the way up my strength ran out. I hung for a while with my foot
stuffed into a root hold.
</p>
<p>
Looking up at Mike, I could see he was concerned. I thought about going down, but I was too
tired. I had about a five second talk with myself and then I went for it, using all the strength
I had left to reach the top.
</p>
<p>
From here we started what was to be an hour long trudge covering about 200 yards. When we got
back to the river it treated us to a great mile of boating, class III and IV with a couple of
class V's. In one of the bigger drops Mike was pushed left into a big hole. A long ride followed
by a rear ender into an ever bigger hole. After another long ride, Mike wound up at the bottom,
laughing.
</p>
<p>
This was some great boating. As the river eased up a bit we found some dynamic playspots. Soon
kayaks were flying and paddles were twirling.
</p>
<p>
Confident grins accompanied us as we flushed out into the mighty Queets. We enjoyed the last few
miles of big water, while we tried to spot the world's largest Douglas Fir.
</p>
<p>
By the time we reached the take-out we were flying high. As we drove the shuttle we relived the
events of the last three days. I had really pushed myself, both physically and mentally. Neither
of us had ever experienced a watershed so untouched, so remote, so special. The world we had
traversed was enchanted. The gorges were stunning and the whitewater was humbling.
</p>
<p>
Someday, I'll do it again.

Ryan Scott and I hiked into Tshletshy over the 4th of July weekend 2011. We spent 2 days hiking and<br/>
2 days boating. It was a fantastic adventure through pristine old growth forest. Plenty of game<br/>
tracks all along the way. We found the hiking and scouting to be not-too-scary and the whitewater<br/>
to be some of the best in the state. On that note, I would recommend doing this trip for the<br/>
adventure, not the whitewater. It is awesome. Plenty of wood as any OP run goes. And the canyons...<br/>
Timing is critical for good spring time flows. Give yourself plenty of time to enjoy this special<br/>
place you've worked so hard to get into. And bring extra food!! </div>
