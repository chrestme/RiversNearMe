<h2>River Description</h2>
<p>
<b>Quick Facts:</b><br>
<br>
Location: Wauwatosa/Milwaukee.<br>
Shuttle Length: 3.5 mile. (See details in &quot;Directions&quot; Tab.)<br>
Character: Artificial dam/ledges, quarry-rock shoals, and some compression waves in the early
going. Bedrock slides and glassy waves (at higher flows) in the lower half.<br>
<br>
Put-in is approximately 660&#39; elevation.<br>
Take-out is approximately 597&#39; elevation.<br>
Thus total elevation change is approximately 63&#39;.<br>
<br>
<strong>General Overview</strong><br>
This <strong>highly</strong> &#39;city-fied&#39; stretch of river has a primarily bedrock
riverbed and fairly confined channel through most of this reach, allowing it&#39;s relatively low
gradient to build some impressive river-wide waves when water levels push up, as they regularly
do after heavy rains.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Be aware that this is an urban watershed. It is VERY
IMPORTANT that you are fully aware of water levels (<strong>and</strong> a realistic assessment
of your skills and ability to handle that water level) before running this stretch of river.
<strong>Water quality (especially at times of high runoff after rainstorms) is
HORRENDOUS.</strong> You do not even want to think about flipping or swimming in this &#39;city
cesspool&#39; of a river. The lower portion of this run (downstream from Jacobus Park/Hawley
Road) lies between vertical stone-wall banks, making exit from the river all but impossible
through most of it at moderate-to-high flows.<br>
<br>
<strong>DO NOT PUT ON DURING HEAVY RAINFALL OR WHEN HEAVY RAIN IS IMMINENT! Water will rise VERY
quickly with heavy rains (easily going from &#39;too low&#39; to &#39;too high&#39;
/DANGEROUS/DEADLY within a half-hour or less!) as water pours off of all the buildings, pavement
and other impermeable surfaces. (Wait until the peak of the rain is past before putting
on.)</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Paddlers are strongly advised not to run with a single craft</strong> (just one solo or
tandem canoe or kayak). In the event of an &#39;out of boat experience&#39; (at moderate-to-high
flows), you are not likely to reclaim your boat and any loose gear until it reaches the
slackwater of the harbor (or at least somewhere downstream of Miller Park). All boaters should be
using a Type-1 (<strong>wearable</strong>) PFD (Personal Floatation Device, that is, a &#39;life
jacket&#39;), fastened securely! Do not rely on seat-cushion or &#39;throwable&#39;
floatation.</span><br>
<br>
At Hawley Road, large quarried limestone rock-rubble lines the river-right bank, making access
and egress possible, but extreme caution is urged. <strong>Even fairly decent sized rocks are
likely to be quite unstable, shifting suddenly under your weight, making footing very
treacherous.</strong> A fall here (especially while carrying a boat) could be very painful.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Access Issues</strong><br>
<br>
Access virtually anyplace on this stream <em>may</em> be problematic. While many runs of various
parts of this river have been done without incident or hassle, we are also aware of groups which
(historically) have been stopped from putting in.<br>
<br>
Milwaukee County code 47.13 provides:
</p>
<blockquote>
<em>&quot;No person shall, without written permission of the department of parks, recreation and
culture, place upon the lagoons, rivers or any of the waters under the control of the department,
any float, boat or other watercraft, nor land or go upon any of the islands of the lagoons or
rivers, nor land or touch with a boat upon any part of the shores not designated as a landing
place. Non-motorized and non-trailered floats, boats, or other watercraft may be used on rivers
controlled by the parks department without written approval of the park director.&quot;</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br>
Boiled down, the first part appears to restrict how and where it may be legal to put-in or get
out, even to stretch or empty your boat (only with written permission, unless at &#39;designated
landing places&#39;), while the second part re-affirms your right to be <em>on</em> the river, so
long as you have otherwise arranged legal put-in and take-out or used a &quot;designated landing
place&quot;.<br>
<br>
The trick is, no public record presently exists as to <i>whether or where</i> any such designated
landing places are located on this river! It is <strong>illegal</strong> to access the river from
any of the (county park) <em>golf courses</em>. <strong>Wauwatosa USED TO ban river
access</strong> from it&#39;s city parks (EG, Hart Park), and was quite aggressive at
enforcement. However, at a common council meeting, Sept.1, 2009, Ordinance O-09-17 was passed,
DELETING Section 7.65.060 (which prohibited launching boats from county parks or parkways).
(Boaters may do well to memorize this date and those numbers, in case some official attempts to
stop you from exercising your legal access!)<br>
<br>
Also, there are those who suggest that (within Milwaukee County and elsewhere) it is legal to
launch within a few feet of any of the &#39;state highway&#39; streets, such as Capitol Drive
(WI-190), Mayfair Road (WI-100), or 76th Street (WI-181). The logic is that the right-of-way (for
the highway and its shoulders/ditches/culverts) at such locations is technically under state (not
city or county) jurisdiction, and the state&#39;s charter assures you the right to freely pass
from one transportation corridor (the road) to another (the river). Some sources go further to
suggest that <em>any</em> public street crossing or public transportation bridge will suffice for
carry-in launch, again citing the right to pass from one <em>&#39;public transportation
corridor&#39;</em> to another. However, I&#39;m not certain that you would be successful using
this argument with any official who chose to take issue with your presence. In general, boaters
are advised (if and when confronted by any authority) to calmly and politely state your position,
but if facing continued challenge, capitulate, move along, and try a different spot, a different
time, or move on to a different run.<br>
<br>
All the above not withstanding, it is highly recommended (regardless where you put-in) to use
&#39;Commando-style&#39; put-in: be as quick and &#39;invisible&#39; as you can. If possible
shuttle boats inside a vechicle (so you don&#39;t &#39;advertise&#39; your presence, and have to
spend time untieing them). Be already dressed and ready to hit the river. Spend as little time as
possible on shore before putting in. I say this mostly because even though the LAW may now be on
our side, there will still be many &#39;good samaritans&#39; who are likely to not be aware of
that, and who will call some official to notify them of your presence. It&#39;s just easier to be
quick and not have to deal with explanations and justifications!<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Any boaters who do opt to put-in <b>upstream</b> of Hoyt
Park (or North Avenue) are advised that immediately after the confluence of Underwood Creek and
the Menomonee River (just downstream from North Avenue), one encounters a drive-thru in a golf
course. At extreme high flows, you can boat over it. At lower flows, this will be problematic.
Further upriver, at the upstream edge of Currie Park, another very low bridge precludes safe
passage even down to fairly low water levels.</span>
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Run Detail</strong><br>
<br>
Early in the run (at low-to-moderate flows) one encounters a number of riverwide waves in a
generally uniform width, unobstructed channel. (At higher flows, these tend to wash out and
become swiftwater choppy waves.) As you approach a railroad track and a lefthand bend, you&#39;ll
encounter a nice series of riffles (or standing waves at higher flows), leading into
&#39;downtown&#39; &#39;Tosa. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(A footbridge here may
accumulate wood -- it would be wise to check this out before making your run.)</span> Passing
through Hart Park and under a footbridge, you may encounter additional wave-train leading to the
confluence with <a href="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/rivers/id/2940" linkindex="55">Honey
Creek</a>. Flatwater, minor swifts and shoals will bring you to the <strong>trestles of a defunct
bridge at Jacobus Park</strong>. <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Approach these with
caution</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">, as they often accumulate strainers.
<strong>Long branches regularly block the entire right and center channel</strong>, and may not
be readily apparent until it is difficult to avoid them. It may be a good idea to stop along the
parkway road while setting shuttle to <strong>scout this area before putting
on.</strong></span><br>
<br>
From this point the gradient increases, and the sloping bedrock (and a few random large rocks)
create more interesting waves and holes. At certain levels, <strong>some</strong> will be
regainable, though more often they tend to be &#39;surf-on-the-fly&#39;.<br>
<br>
Take-out is at an area of channelization just downstream of 45th Street, before the river
re-enters a cement ditch. Large rock rubble lines the channel, making footing treacherous. At
higher boatable waterlevels, most of the rock will be covered, allowing you to float over them to
take out on the paved approach to the river. However, be aware of foot entrapment concerns if out
of your boat but still in the water in this area. These rocks will make exit from the river
awkward when the water level is lower, and you will have to carry out across those rocks. Watch
your footing!<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">CAUTION: It is most strongly recommended not to proceed
beyond recommended takeout without full knowledge and scouting of what lies below. The river
becomes a walled-in cement ditch, caroming off RR bridge piers and having no eddies for the next
mile until reaching the parking lots at Miller Park (Milwaukee Brewers&#39; baseball stadium).
While there may be a couple playable waves (or potentially interesting features, notably under

cement ditch which has caused flush-drownings of kids from time to time) is likely to be viewed

and high water means strong likelihood of CSO affecting the river downstream.</span><br>

***This is <strong>upstream</strong> of the listed put-in for this reach.***</p>
<p>
Anyone who opts to put-in further upstream (or on a tributary run upstream) should be aware that this bridge will be impassible at moderate-to-high flows. You can easily get under at flows less than 500 cfs or so. It is still &#39;duckable&#39; (in a whitewater kayak) up to 1180 cfs but a canoe would be in trouble! Most levels between 800 and 2200 cfs you will have to get ashore and portage. (This may not be easy!) Somewhere around and above 2400 cfs, you may pass over the bridge with little or no problem.</p>
<p>
Depending upon how far upstream you start, there are other low bridges (specifically in Currie Park, between Capitol Drive and Mayfair Road) which will cause problems at high flows.</p><br>

While the shuttle mapping ends with you still on the Menomonee River Parkway, we recommend that you proceed to Swan Blvd (stop light), turn left to cross the river, then turn left into the parking lot. Drive about halfway back, then turn left down an aisle to park in the northmost spots. We recommend you be ready to do a &quot;grab-and-go&quot; (a quick and discrete put-in . . . there are those who may not be aware of the ordinance change confirming your right to access the river from here, and it is easiest to minimize any opportunity for anyone to protest your presence).

</div>
</div> 
<p>
A small (artificial) &#39;ledge&#39; spans the river. At lower levels (up to maybe 400-500 cfs) this will be a uniform pourover. While it should easily be &#39;punched&#39; or &#39;boofed&#39; with downstream momentum, it may be very sticky if dropped into without momentum or if paddled up into from below. At these low flows, the main &#39;meaningful&#39; activity it is likely to provide is hole-escape practice (if you want to do so in such foul water as is typical of this stream). At medium flows (somewhere above 500-600 cfs, perhaps up to somewhere near 1200-1500 cfs) the ledge is swamped and may form a sweet, tame, playable wave. At higher flows (somewhere over 1230 cfs), there will be virtually no sign of the ledge.</p><br>

<p>
Rubble fill (erosion control) creates a splish-splash rapids. At low water (below 300 cfs), expect to &#39;ground out&#39; through here. At certain levels, a minor wave-train will develop.</p>
<p>
A utility box culvert cuts diagonally across the streambed at the start of the &nbsp;rubble/rapids. Far river-left there may be minor play (surfs, possible spins) available. In the pool downstream of the rubble rips, there is good depth and some strong currents which could allow some vertical play (bow-stalls, stern-squirts) in freestyle kayaks and squirt boats (other than for the water quality which makes me uninclined to play).</p><br>

<p>
Along this stretch there are two more artificial ledges (formed by utility box culverts) will create either tame drops, somewhat sticky pourovers, or waves that may allow playboaters some surfing opportunities. (These ledges/transects are not precisely identical in characteristics and play/danger potential, but have <em>generally similar</em> flow/play correlations.)</p><br>

As the river heads toward the railroad embankment and takes a moderate left bend, it encounters a bit of a shoals, and (at moderately high water) a nice wave-train will be found through this area.

</div>
</div> 
<p>
After passing under a bike-path bridge and the road bridge (and just before getting to a railroad bridge), you come to a pedestrian bridge in the heart of Wauwatosa (formerly a road bridge). This bridge has pilings into the river which unfortunately have a pronounced propensity for accumulating wood (sticks, branches, whole trees). Approach this area with caution (especially at higher water levels), or better yet, <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">SCOUT this bridge (while you are running your shuttle) to be aware of the conditions here</span>.</p><br>

A sweeping right-hand bend occurs as you enter Hart Park. The inside (right) of the bend is shallow gravel shoals, while the outside (left) is deeper water with a fine wave-train. Be alert (look well downstream) as you near this area, as it has been the site of trees falling or hanging up and blocking much of the current. Do not get too near the left shore, as there are often roots or overhanging branches to catch you or your boat.<br/><br/>Also, as shown in the photo, be aware that the river and banks through here are strewn with cement slabs. While I have not seen any rebar, the course and angular cement would be brutal to anyone upside-down or out of their boat through this stretch. (DO NOT TRY TO STAND OR WALK IN ANY CURRENT THROUGH HERE! Scraped, bruised, and battered ankles and shins at the least, and foot entrapment at the worst, are very possible here.)<br>

<p>
Honey Creek enters from river-right. At high water, and depending upon the relative levels of the two streams, the merging currents can create some interesting action here. There is generally good depth (at higher flows) to allow decked playboats some &#39;vertical&#39; opportunities (bow-stalls, stern-squirts). It should be noted, however, that there is (right at the confluence) one stray failed gabion (wire basket filled with rocks), as well as the sort of rubble pictured above.</p><br>

<p>
Another short-run option is to put in from the parkway at this location. You cut off the first 2.0 miles of mostly swiftwater and low-grade riffles, and you get the final 1.6 miles containing the best gradient. This may also be the better option for high-flow runs, since a number of bridges upstream can end up deadly (low to the flow or with water flowing through bridge structures). Downstream of here there still may be one or two bridges which could be of concern, and would need scouting before putting on the run at any flow which may exceed 3000 cfs.</p><br>

</div> 
<p>
The remaining evidence of a long-gone bridge (in Jacobus Park) is a pair of bridge-piers (splitting the river into three channels). While they generally should prove no problem to the experienced paddler, they are a potential hazard.<br/>
<br/>
First off, they are &#39;faced&#39; with Lannon Stone, but the lower portion has weathered away, leaving what amounts to an <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">&#39;undercut&#39; leading face on these piers</span>. Boaters should give the piers wide berth to avoid being caught on the upstream face and flipped into the undercut.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, these <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">piers often collect large woody debris</span>. I have seen the right channel (from shore to the right-side bridge pier) completely blocked off, and often trees/branches will block half or more across the center channel (where the strongest flow will take you).<br/>
<br/>
Current is swift heading into this area, as there is a minor bit of rock-rubble rapids leading into the bridge piers. <font color="#ff0000">Boaters are strongly advised to scout this location ahead of time (while you are running your shuttle) to be aware of the situation here before putting on the run. Look very carefully, as sometimes a branch may be just beneath the flow out across the center channel -- not a problem if you are right-side-up and hit it squarely, but a canoe or kayak could snag it and cause a world of problems for paddlers not well versed in swiftwater/whitewater paddling.</font><br/>
<br/>
Whitewater playboaters may find some fun here, as (at least at moderate-to-higher flows -- over 400 cfs) there are some wild eddies. A potentially playable wave often forms immediately downstream of the bridge piers (at flows from about 250 cfs up to 1000 or more). While the wave is shallow &#39;up front&#39;, there is generally pretty fair depth in the center channel through the pool below.</p>

Just upstream, the river encounters bedrock streambed, and the fun to begins! As the river slides down the slightly angled rock, it accelerates and then stacks up a fine waves through here. They become playable somewhere in the 400-500 cfs range, and become more and more fun as levels increase into the 1000+ cfs range. Around 2000 cfs, there are a couple big waves (and a decent shoreline eddy river-right), with at least one breaking nicely on itself, making a wonderful ride for repeat play.</p>

<p>
The name (obviously an intentional bit of a play on words) alludes to the location at Hawley Road, as well as a reference and tribute to the Wood Veterans Hospital which is not far to the south of here.<br/>
<br/>
A few large chunks of slab-rock sit in the middle of the river. At low flows, they divide the waters. At moderate flows, they create a pretty fair hole which is probably best avoided by the majority of boaters. Immediately downstream (where the former Hawley Road bridge spanned the river, lower and just upstream of the newer and higher bridge which carries Hawley Road traffic now), at certain levels, some minor playable waves can sometimes form.<br/>
<br/>
This location (before the flanks of the old Hawley Road bridge) is the last reasonable exit from the river before it becomes completely walled-in by vertical stonework banks. While there are a couple places where it may be possible to get out of the river between here and the listed take-out, they are not easy or necessarily obvious without prior knowledge or scouting.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">If you do get out here and try to go up to street level (or, conversely, if you park at this location and try to access the river here) be aware that the rock rubble which lines the river-right bank is very dangerous footing. Rocks may shift underfoot, and a slip or fall here would be very painful.</span><br>

<p>
Another area of sloping bedrock allows the sweetest set of waves to form in this area. Only problem is, when the waves are at their best, there&#39;s no eddies. These will be totally &#39;catch-on-the-fly&#39;, one-ride thrills. At low levels (200-400 cfs) there may be a couple of minor playable holes here (if that). At moderate levels (400-900 cfs), you&#39;ll start to see the potential. As levels hit the 1000+ range, you should find some SWEET smooth glassy waves! (Oh, and, if you catch it above 2000, it mostly becomes a sloshing surging slapping chop! You may still find something to ride, but it is more likely you will just enjoy the clapotis-like chaotic waves.)</p>
<p>
A group of playboaters who all want to have their hand at surfing these sweet rides will have to &#39;queue up&#39; upstream (finding whatever slackwater along shore as they can), to let each (one-at-a-time) take their turn trying to catch this series of waves. As the first boater(s) drop off the first wave (or two) in the series, other boaters may slip out of their shoreline micro-eddy to take their rides. As the lead boaters get to the last of the waves, they will no doubt need to find slackwater/eddies (which are more reasonable at the end of the wave sequence) to wait as the rest of the group finishes their ride sequence.</p>
<p>
For the sake of safety, it is a good idea to keep an eye on each other here, and not proceed downstream until all have had their rides. Again, the vertical stone walls make any rescue or recovery very difficult if anyone suffers an &#39;out-of-boat&#39; experience. Low-boatable flows (200-450 cfs) may not be a problem, but as levels rise (and make these waves FUN), swimmers will be hard pressed to find a place to get to shore, and gear is likely not to be collected until well past the normal take-out.</p>

<p>
A pile of rocks and rubble has accumulated in the riverbed (swept downstream to here in various flood events). At relatively lower flows (under 400-500 cfs) most or all the water will be channeled to far-left, where the riverbank is a vertical rock wall. At these low flows a couple minor surfable waves may form here. There may be enough force and depth to get endered out, if you don&#39;t mind the likelihood of banging the tail of your boat against the wall as you drop out of the ender/piroouette (and if you are skilled enough to assure a right-side-up landing . . . not sure that depth remains sufficient to not suffer cranial impact). At some low-to-moderate flows, a line of rocks more to center of the river may create a pourover hole or (with slightly more flow) a wave/hole. Surfs may be possible at some flows, but be aware that there is much shallow rubble downstream center and river-right. Repeat play of some of these features may be possible at some flows. As with so many of the features on this run, it is really the luck-of-the-draw as to how well-formed anything will be, since flows rise and fall so rapidly. If you happen to be inclined to &#39;do laps&#39; (shuttle up to run the whole reach again), expect this to be totally different one run to the next!</p>

<p>
After you pass under Hwy.41 (high overhead), the river will bank off to the left. Downstream, a railroad bridge-pier splits the flow at an area of rock-rubble rapids. There is a small catch-on-the-fly trough/wave tight to the right at the head of the rips (surfs/spins possible at some flows).</p>
<p>
As you head toward the railroad bridge (as elsewhere on this run) be very watchful for possible woody debris hung up on the bridge pier. (Always safest to head to the inside of the bend, river-left, if you have concerns. Current is more slack and the riverbank is low so it is possible to get out if need be, whereas river-right is an inescapable vertical rock wall.) The pool below the bridge is deep and will have wild swirls and boils at flows over 1000 cfs.</p>
<p>
In the main (right) channel, at some flows, at the upstream-edge of the bridge, there can be a decent bit of a wave. It is tough (if not impossible) to catch on the fly, but it is often possible to attain up the river-left channel, or tight against the vertical-steel revetment, to try for surfs on this wave.</p>

<p>
As you pass under the 45th Street Bridge, you encounter an area of remediated streambed. Years back this next stretch of river was wall-to-wall cement. That has been removed, and large quarried rock lines the river bed and banks, and creates a swift but &#39;minor&#39; choppy rips from here to the take-out. Anyone so unfortunate as to flip or swim here is likely to be punished by multiple impacts with this shallow quarried rock in very swift currents. Be very careful not to try to stand in any strong flow, as foot entrapment, bruises, broken bones, and worse are a serious possibility.</p>
<br>

</div><div id='zzqb7v99df5phrdRiverRapidView64' class='CRiverRapidView-view CRiverRapidView'> <b><a name="rapid5694">Take-out!!!</a></b> (Class N/A, Mile 3.6)<br>
<p>
The take-out is on river-right, midway down this area which is lined by quarry rock. As a result, the convenience or inconvenience of your egress will be largely a function of the water level.<br/>
<br/>
At levels of low-to-mid hundreds, you will have to hit slackwater and kind-of &#39;moor&#39; your boat against a rock, very carefully get out of your boat (holding onto it, or having a buddy do so), and carefully standing onto the rocks, pick up or drag your boat until you are across the rocks and on the paved area. You will need to be VERY careful walking across these rock. A slip or fall will be painful.<br/>
<br/>
At flows near 1000 cfs, as you near the take-out area, paddle tight to the right bank, sliding down a paved &#39;shoulder&#39;, and right in to the slackwater for your exit, and you will not have to deal with the rock rubble shoreline.<br/>
<br/>
At higher flows (somewhere above 1000) all rocks here will be well covered, and you can easily charge the break in the wall for the landing.<br/>
<br/>
While some rapids and swiftwater continue beyond this break in the wall (the recommended take-out), just downstream the river enters a completely cemented ditch from which exit will be impossible until the parking lot at the baseball stadium. Any features to be found down this latter reach do not merit the extra dangers and length involved in being in this cement ditch. As of fall, 2013, MMSD has initiated removal of 1000&#39; of this concrete (from below the railroad/chicane down to Wisconsin Avenue), to be replaced with quarried rock to form rills and pools. The cement &#39;chicane&#39; will remain (so as not to disturb the foundations of the railroad trestles), as will the next 2200&#39;+ of cement from Wis.Ave. to just beyond I-94. (A future project is to address removal of most of that cement as well.)</p>

<p>
Just beyond the recommended take-out, a Combined Sewer pipe dumps into the river and the river drops into a &#39;cement ditch&#39; with quite uniform slope and steep walls. Almost immediately around the bend, it passes under a railroad trestle, taking a quick jog to the left. The sudden turn in the cement ditch leaves a monstrous looking hole tight to the left, though you could barely end up in it unless you really tried quite hard. At high flows, the bridge pier on river-right splits the flow so some water passes around it to the right, while the main flow banks off its left face. A wild combination of wrapping currents ensue as the water rejoins and realigns to continue down the cement ditch.</p>
<p>
As of winter, 2013/2014, there is a project to remove more of this cement ditch, replacing it with quarried rock. This project appears to be &#39;on hold&#39; during spring flows, presumably to resume late-spring/early-summer. We will have to see how substantially this alters matters downstream. Perhaps in the future, it may be interesting to continue the run down to Miller Stadium parking areas (at least, when there is not a game going on).</p>

<p>As the river encounters the railroad a second time, a bridge pier splits the flow, and the river is narrowed a bit. There is some unevenness in the riverbed which can act like a bit of a ledge, creating some minor play at this site. Generally I believe it is 'best' (which is still not saying much) at low-to-moderate flows.&nbsp;Immediately downstream the river passes under the Interstate (I-94), and into the area surrounding the baseball stadium (Miller Park).</p><br>

There is a bridge for the golf course just downstream of the confluence of Underwood Creek and the<br/>
Menomonee River (which is just downstream of North Avenue, near Mayfair Shopping Center). At low<br/>
flows (less than 600 cfs or so), this will easily allow passage under. Around 1200-1300 cfs, only<br/>
the most limber boaters laying against the deck of a small kayak can get under -- canoes will not<br/>
pass! Getting out to get around may be tricky! At some high flows (somewhere over 1500 cfs) this<br/>
can be run, but some flows may create a wicked pourover/hole. Fortunately, the bridge deck is<br/>
uniformly flat concrete (no 'lip' on either edge and no side-rails). </div>

As mentioned in the full write-up, at times of heavy rains, this section of river is VERY LIKELY to<br/>
suffer from Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO). It is recommended that you check the MMSD website<br/>
**************************** http://v3.mmsd.com/OverflowAdvisory.aspx ****************************<br/>
for conditions before running this reach when there have been heavy rains, then decide for yourself<br/>
if you wish to risk boating in the (diluted) sewage affecting this river. Areas affected should<br/>
generally be clear (of the bulk of that specific contamination) a couple days after the CSO ends.<br/>
(Of course, by then this reach will be too low to run.) </div>

There are two spots in particular on this run which seem highly prone to catching LARGE trees and<br/>
branches, forming strainers which can span most (or all) of the river. I believe county or<br/>
municipality (or private individual?) crews periodically clear major snags, but new snags are<br/>
likely during and after every high-water event. Caution (and scouting while setting shuttle) is<br/>
always advised. The first common location for snags is against a midstream pier for the pedestrian<br/>
bridge in 'downtown' Wauwatosa (the bridge used to be part of Harwood Avenue before being converted<br/>
to pedestrian only). The second location at Jacobus Park where the remnants of two bridge piers<br/>
split the river into three channels. VERY OFTEN the right pier is piled with logs which obstruct<br/>
the right and center channel. BE VERY CAREFUL! Often a good-sized branch will lie just at or under<br/>
water, and can snag your boat! Current heading into both of these areas will be fairly swift (at<br/>
most/best boatable flows) so you will have to be looking well downstream and planning ahead to<br/>
safely navigate this area when snags are present. Again, the best advice is to scout both of these<br/>
locations while driving shuttle, before putting on upstream! Make certain you have adequate passage<br/>
(and adequate skills) to get safely around (and to know which direction you can get around) or get<br/>
safely ashore before these locations if need be. </div>
