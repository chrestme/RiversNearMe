<h2>River Description</h2>
<p>
<b>Quick Facts:</b><br>
<br>
Location: northwest edge of city of Racine.<br>
Shuttle Length: 0.2-0.6 miles. (See details in &quot;Directions&quot; Tab.)<br>
Character: High (relatively) tree-lined banks provide almost a 'wilderness' feel in a county
park, where sloping bedrock creates fine playable features.<br>
<br>
Put-in is approximately 620' elevation.<br>
Take-out is approximately 600' elevation.<br>
Thus total elevation change is approximately 20'.<br>
<br>
Shallow bedrock ledges in a fairly uniform width, unobstructed channel create a sweet series of
green (ok, more like brown) waves for surfs and (at high water) major freestyle action. Many who
have done this reach (at levels above 1400-1800 cfs) have proclaimed it contains among of the
best play waves in the state! Not bad, considering it's in the southeast corner of the state
where one would not expect to find good whitewater!<br>
<br>
Access and parking are convenient both at the <em>upper put-in</em> by the Horlick Dam and at the
take-out in Quarry Lake Park. (Most boaters just park at the take-out and carry up to their
chosen put-in.<br>
<br>
In winter or early spring when the water is up, don't let a windy, raw day discourage you from
boating this reach. High banks flank the river, sheltering you from <em>almost</em> all wind
conditions while on the water. (It will only be a factor as you 'carry up' in the park.) I've
boated it with the temperature in the low 30's, and wind-chills of single-digits or teens, and
have been fine while on the river. Additionally, the existence of the dam and its millpond (at
the head of this reach) holds back ice in winter. The stretch that we boat downstream of the dam
will often flush free of ice after a day or two of winter warming, allowing for reasonably safe
boating.<br>
<br>
Be aware this is a VERY popular fishing stream. During spring (March/April) and fall (October +/-
2weeks) when the Steelhead, Salmon, Trout, etc., are running, be prepared to share the river with
scores of anglers. Fortunately water levels most conducive to boating are unfavorable for
fishing, so there is seldom a problem. Most fishermen will be found up by the dam (down to the
first bend), and down in the pool below the final playspot (and along the golf course river
frontage downstream).<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">(Note: On weekends during summer, when staff is on duty
(roughly 8am-6:30pm) a <b>$1 per person</b> park fee <em>may</em> be charged for admittance to
Quarry Park.)</span>

<table><tbody><tr><td>In general, running dams is highly discouraged. Many low-head dams are 'killing machines' at a wide variety of water levels. This dam is a rather notable exception. The cement face of the dam slopes nicely, and flairs to a smooth horizontal 'kicker'. Water at the base of the dam generally 'sheets' away quickly due to the generally shallow bedrock of the riverbed downstream. At high waterlevels (above 800 or 1000 cfs) the left half of the dam does develop a bit of a nasty looking hydraulic, but the right half still generally sheets out fairly reasonably.</td><td><img src="http://www.americanwhitewater.org/photos/archive/15052.gif" alt=""/></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br/>Again, not meaning to encourage anyone to run it, but the question comes up with great regularity. So, yes, the dam has been run numerous times. Levels below 300 cfs you'll be grinding down the cement on a thin sheet of water. From about 300 to somewhere in the 500 - 800 level it's a quick smooth slip down the face. Above that, things can start to look a bit scary. Highest presently known run is about 1500 cfs, Christmas day, 2006, no less! <br/><br/>It is important to note that there is much shallow bedrock&nbsp;at the base of the dam, and much rocky rubble about halfway&nbsp;down toward the next feature ('Malted Milk'). If you flip at the base of the dam, you are likely to have trouble rolling as you are raked across all this bedrock and rocky debris.<br/><br/>And, for what it's worth, there is a viewing deck off the back of the bar at the motel on river-right. You are likely to attract an audience of patrons cheering you on and pulling out their cellphone/cameras.</p><br>

<i>Horlick Dam and Malted Milk</i></div><div>Photo by Rob Smage taken 04/09/09 @ 160 cfs</div></div> <br style='clear:both'>
</div>
</div> 
<p>
The name derives from one of Racine&#39;s former claims to fame. The Horlick company patented a Malted Milk process, and sold their product for nearly a century.<br/>
<br/>
At low to moderate levels (250-800 cfs) the sloping bedrock and very minor ledge (to the left) form a decent playable wave (though it barely deserves the same name, hence at these levels call it &#39;<i>Horlick&#39;s Extra Lite</i>&#39;).<br/>
<br/>
It is at higher levels (about 1200-1500 cfs) that this wave really earns it&#39;s name, as to dishes out into a wide, glassy wave. Sweet surfs and spins can be done, often with a smally gallery of spectatators on the Northwestern Avenue bridge just behind and overhead.<br/>
<br/>
This feature may wash-out a bit or surge and become chaotic at different levels over 1800-2000. While it may offer some great surfs, it is less predictable or assured than at more moderate levels (1200-1500 or so).</p>

<i>Diagonal Slice</i></div><div>Photo by Rob Smage taken 04/09/09 @ 160 cfs</div></div> <br style='clear:both'>
</div>
</div> 
<p>
Not far downstream from the Northwestern Avenue bridge (and the USGS gauge site), a large eddy exists on the right, as the river twists off to the left. At levels above 600 cfs or so, there will generally be sufficient depth in the eddy and enough current differential to allow those who are so inclined to charge into the eddy, plow down the bow, and try for bow-stalls and &#39;eddy-wheels&#39;.&nbsp;This may also be a good spot for beginners to practice peeling-out into the current, and charging back into the eddy.<br/>
<br/>
As the river bears off to the left (just out of this eddy), it falls across a small diagonal bedrock ledge, &#39;<em>Diagonal Slice</em>&#39;. At low-to-moderate levels (~300-700 cfs) this can allow some odd surfs in shallow wrapping twisting currents. At 1000-1500 or so, it provides very interesting and challenging surfs. At higher levels, this completely washes out.</p>
<p>
Be aware that there are large cement slabs (<strong>no</strong> exposed rebar, thankfully) river-right immediately downstream. One large slab lies center-river about 50 yards downstream. This will be completely covered at most boatable flows, and will only be of concern if you are upside-down (flailing and failing to roll quickly) or out of your boat coming out of &#39;Diagonal Slice&#39;.</p>

<p>The area between the upper features and the lower features is mostly just flat and flowing. However, at levels above 1000 cfs or so, a series of small but sweet catch-on-the-fly glassy waves (riffles) do form. Turn bow upstream and paddle hard to stall onto the best among them, or (if you are of a mind and body to) try a few wave-wheels down the small wave-train.</p><br>

<p>A huge hunk of concrete (remnant of an old bridge from the quarrying days) lies on river right along the stretch of 'doldrums'. At moderate water levels (maybe 500-1000 cfs), this forms a fine place to practice charging into and catching an eddy, as well as peeling out of the eddy. At the higher end of levels cited, it allows bow stalls and stern squirts on a well defined eddy line. The eddy becomes a bit dynamic (swirly and boily) making an interesting place for novice boaters to learn how to deal with those currents as well. Unfortunately, flooding in 2008 has pushed this slightly more diagonal to the current, pushing more water toward shore, diminishing the eddy and the play potential (minor though it always was).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr/><br>

</div>
</div> 
<p>This is the first feature on the lower part of the run. Most boaters will just put in here for most runs at most levels, foregoing the upper features since they hardly justify the extra carry-up/shuttle at many levels. <br/><br/>A shoreline eddy/pool to 'stage' from exists among the trees on river left.<br/><br/>At low-to-moderate levels (200-700 cfs), a river-right pocket-wave/hole ('<em>Upper Pipeline Right</em>' or '<em>UPR</em>') exists, with a narrow and short shoreline eddy. Sweet surfs and flatspins can be done at will, but you have to paddle hard for the eddy when you come off the wave or you will be flushed too far downstream to be able to regain it. <br/><br/>There is also a river-left wave/hole&nbsp; ('<em>Upper Pipeline Left</em>' or '<em>UPL</em>'). At low-to moderate levels, this one is exceedingly shallow and scrapey, and hardly worth any time or effort. As the level rises, the UPR washes out, but UPL builds quite nicely. At higher water (1000 cfs and up) this one becomes a sweet surf (especially nice around 1500 cfs). Again, there is only a narrow and short shoreline eddy, so you have to come off the wave in good control and paddle hard for the eddy or you will be flushed too far downstream to be able to regain it. Additionally, at the downstream end of the eddy, there are trees on the shore overhanging the river which can become quite worrisome. Strong, confident paddlers who are swept back close to these trees may be able to 'throw their back into them' and push off to secure the eddy. However, more paddlers (as soon as you realize you are not being able to make it into the eddy) will quickly paddle hard (away from shore) to avoid tangling with them.<br/><br/>Also, it should be noted, 'post flood' (since June, 2008) the eddy for UPL will not extend far enough upstream (at lower flows) to allow repeat play. As levels reach somewhere around 1100-1200, water spreads across what is normally shore. It is then possible (not easy, but possible) to 'pull' your way up this eddy. As levels exceed 1300 (+/-) the eddy gets much more manageable.</p><br>

Other features on this run come and go (I.E., are good at some levels but either disappear or are lame at other levels), but this is one of the best features at the widest variety of water levels.<br/>
<br/>
To surf the main wave, it is generally best to charge hard into a river-left eddy just before these features. A diagonal &#39;shoulder wave&#39; feeds out of the eddy, across to center river where a flattened-out V-wave exists. At most playable water levels, it is nearly impossible to catch that wave &#39;on-the-fly&#39; unless you use the eddy and shoulder-wave to slide across and onto it.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
At any level over about 250-300 cfs, the main wave extends from center to river-right shore. It allows great side-surf practice (especially nice for beginners) and has a natural &#39;kick&#39; into a left-hand flatspin. Front surfs, blasting and spins against the grain can be pursued by more experienced boaters for variety. It is also interesting to practice surfing from center all the way across to river right and back, feeling and reacting to the differing currents in the shallow, steep-faced wave.<br/>
<br/>
At river left (immediately downstream of the wide wave here) lies &quot;Tundra&quot; (so named because it lies &#39;below the pipeline&#39; (think the Alaskan oil pipeline), and also to honor the &quot;frozen tundra&quot; of Lambeau Field, home of the Green Bay Packers). This is a narrower wave (than Lower Pipeline), but it builds up very sweetly as levels go from 300 to somewhere around 1000 or so. This wave is especially fine at around 700-1000, allowing great surfs, spins, and grinds (side-slipping a green wave). Unfortunately, &#39;post flood&#39;, this wave has been seriously affected. Much of the rock rubble (which was just upstream on shore) washed away, and (as a result) the wave is not as well-formed (at almost any water level), and the eddy service for this wave is greatly diminished (difficult to impossible to catch for repeat play).</td>

<br/>
Fortunately, a sweet feature here is that from the center-river slackwater which backs up the main wave (Lower Pipeline), it is possible (at levels from 300 to about 1000) to paddle upstream in the slackwater, over the back of the wave and slide back in to surf the main (Lower Pipeline) wave. After playing that to your heart&#39;s content, experienced boaters can slide from the center of that wave, back across some minor turbulence, and onto Tundra.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
As levels rise above 1000 cfs, Tundra tends to wash out, but the main wave (Lower Pipeline) builds to ever sweeter proportions. It becomes difficult or impossible to regain from the center-river slackwater, but a slick trick allows continued access for repeat play. Higher water (near 2000 cfs and up) allows paddlers to sneak up through the trees on river-left. Doing a little &#39;pull-up&#39; on a couple tree-trunks to regain the upper eddy will allow one to access the shoulder-wave to slide back out on the main wave. As levels rise (from 1000 to 2000 or more), this wave just becomes bigger and steeper, turning into a wall of water (especially the further river-right you go). If this wave doesn&#39;t amaze you at these levels, you either are not a &#39;wave boater&#39; or you&#39;ve done considerable travelling to boat some amazing rivers elsewhere.</td>

<p>Not far downstream of Tundra (or, where Tundra used to be, pre-flood), in the river-left flow, at higher levels (1000+ cfs), a wave forms. Some boaters have been enjoying sweet surfs here. This lies just downstream of a willow on shore which (years and years ago) toppled, to there is a horizontal trunk anchored to the ground, and a substantial vertical branch/tree. You will also see a substantial size trunk/limb which has been cut. This had been a sizable limb overhanging the river, which broke off in a storm wome years back. What remained (until it was sawed off) was about an eight-to-ten foot angled (almost horizontal) stump, the end of which had cracked in half, nearly 2' back, having almost the appearance of the gaping jaws of an alligator. The name of this wave recollects the once 'gaping jaw' of that tree.</p><p><br/>&nbsp;</p><br>

<p>A natural bedrock intrusion (tight to shore on the right) creates a pour-over/pocket-wave/hole. At levels maybe 300-800 cfs or so, this tight (narrow) pocket allows interesting play. Boaters who are confident having their boat 'on edge' may surf and spin in this short, narrow, pourover/pocket of a hole. You will have to really focus on your upstream edge and your 'edge transitions' to keep from tripping-up in this pour-over.<br/><br/>Out in center-river to river-left, sloping bedrock forms a wider, smoother wave. The same eddy that serves the previously mentioned pourover/wave/hole will allow repeat play on the main wave. A&nbsp;large eddy also exists river-left, but regaining the wave from there is difficult-to-impossible at most flows.</p><p>This feature actually allows (minor, tame) play down to 150 cfs and lower! It's probably at its best from 400 to 600 or more. As flows push higher, the wave mostly washes out into a fast shallow wave or into little more than a minor wave-train.<br/>&nbsp;</p><hr/><br>

<p>This is a combination of lesser features. Many boaters will bypass them entierely. In fact, at many levels, these features will not exist or will provide minimal if any play. When present, they generally provide only tame play. Catching them is more about river-running moves (holding a good ferry angle to cross the main current a couple of times).<br/> <br/> <b>Fenceline (FL)</b> is a small bedrock intrusion which extends from river-left to center-river. It can (at low-to-moderate levels) form a minor riffle of a wave, providing very minor (beginner) diversion. At high levels, this does create a nice trough (fairly wide across the river, but not tall or deep) which can be caught on the fly and will allow nice surfs and spins. The river is quite shallow here any time the feature is 'in', so if you flip, you will encounter bottom.<br/> <br/> <b>Right Hip Pocket (RHP)</b>&nbsp;is another small bedrock intrusion&nbsp;tight to&nbsp;river-right. At moderate levels this forms a rather funky little wrapping pourover/wave/hole for interesting surfs and spins (good practice for keeping the boat 'on edge' and switching edges on the spin). <br/> <br/> <b>Good Intentions (GI)</b>&nbsp;is a third minor wave/hole which lies tight to river left. Levels need to be moderate to high (500 cfs or more) for this to be worthwhile. It can be a bit of a challenge to play RHP and then try to make the cross-river ferry and catch GI. <br/> <br/> <b>Mid-Evil (ME)</b>&nbsp;is a sweet standing wave that lies in a left-hand-bend in the river. This wave is generally caught one of two ways. The tree/snag on river-right has almost completely blown out by flooding 2008.06.09. At some levels, there will still be a micro-eddy on this shore from which you can slide out onto the wave. (It makes good river-running practice to make the move from GI to the river-right micro eddy, which, of course, is good practice at catching narrow, funky, shoreline eddies.) Altenatively, you can stay in slackwater river-left (downstream of Good Intentions) on an upstream ferry and slide across a small shoulder-wave which runs diagonally out to center-river. ME never really builds to a size to allow much other than straight-on front surfs (OK, sometimes some boats/boaters can flatspin on it). In spite of that, there are boaters who will relish the ride on this smooth wave.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Brink of Evil (BE)</b>&nbsp;is a sweet small glassy wave which forms just above 'All Evil'.at some flows (notably, around 1100-1300 cfs). This is a fine semi 'gutsy' surf for advanced boaters, since you must come off in control and take a couple strong strokes to head quickly to river-left, to 'lip' the edge of the hole, or (failing that) you will be swept backwards or sideways (with little momentum) into the heart of the hole at All Evil.</p><br>

<p>This is where the rodeo crowd will hang out when the river is running large. This is the most pronounced ledge on the river (though still tiny by most whitewater river standards), and is backed up by a good sized pool, with generally pretty good depth. As levels change (up or down), one can often watch this feature change from hour to hour (sometimes within moments, right before your eyes). <br/><br/>While the ledge is river-wide, differences in how the wave/hole forms up are significant. River-left is always a bigger pourover/wave/hole, while river-right tends to be a much tamer wave. Thus, they are referred to (respectively) as the <i>&quot;Greater Evil&quot;</i> and the <i>&quot;Lesser Evil&quot;</i>. It is really only at higher levels (above 1400 cfs or so) that they merge into one big hole, <b>All Evil (of the Root)</b>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This area can also provide play (front surfs, side surfs, flat spins, blasting) down to 150 cfs and lower.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Take-out is at river-left from the pool at this drop. Downstream the riverbed changes from bedrock to rubble and mud/clay/silt, and one encounters only relatively minor riffles and shoals. Continuing (boating) past this pool would mean having to set a shuttle, whereas one can get the best action by just carrying up within Quarry Park.<br/><br/>A golf course (Racine Country Club) spans the river downstream of this pool. There are reports (and signs) indicating they can be fairly aggressive about enforcing trespass on their property (including the bridge downstream here). Boaters playing &quot;All Evil&quot; are advised (if they swim, or are otherwise swept downstream of the pool) to be as quick and 'invisible' as possible in getting back upstream to Quarry Park.</p><br>

The county has upgraded the fence both at the 'short put-in' by 'Upper Pipeline' and the one near<br/>
the highway bridge and USGS gauge building, and they have put up new signs. As of April, 2010 they<br/>
have locked the gate in the fence at 'Upper Pipeline'. While it is possible to walk around the<br/>
fence, last summer there was an increase in enforcement of this area being 'off limits'. (Kids in<br/>
the park jumping off the cliff into the quarry after lifeguards had gone for the day were ticketed<br/>
and fined, and I believe the amount was in the neighborhood of $150!) I doubt that they are as<br/>
stringent in enforcement of fishermen who routinely hike up and down this area, or that they are<br/>
likely to do so most times when the river is 'up' and boaters are likely to use the path to carry<br/>
to the upper put-in. However, for those occasions when you do the 'full run', you may want to<br/>
consider *either* carrying out of the park entrance and up the sidewalk outside the park *or* doing<br/>
a vehicle shuttle, especially if this river runs anytime during summer. </div>

At levels above 2000 cfs boaters should be aware that two bridges downstream in the golf course<br/>
will be serious hazards. They will have not enough clearance under them for you to conveniently<br/>
pass under, and (with higher flows) water will flow through the railings on them. They are far<br/>
enough downstream that experienced boaters in control will be nowhere near them as they run and<br/>
play the features on this reach. However, if you need to chase errant gear downriver (in the event<br/>
of someone having a 'yard sale' swim), strong currents may make it difficult to paddle out of<br/>
danger around these two bridges. </div>

DO NOT take boats which have been in the river and then paddle in the quarry. The river (being<br/>
connected with Lake Michigan) is &quot;affected water&quot; for VHS (Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia), while the<br/>
quarry is NOT. Any boat used in the river needs to be thoroughly cleaned (rinsed in bleach!<br/>
according to guidelines) before using it in the quarry. By the same token, boaters are advised they<br/>
should not jump into or swim in the quarry after having been in the river without first taking a<br/>
thorough shower with soap (available in the park pavillion when it is open). While odds are<br/>
probably slim that the DNR personnel would be there to enforce this, you could be subject to a fine<br/>
for either action (as I understand it). </div>
