Putting in at Scott&#39;s Gulf Road end we had to portage across the small island to get to
deeper more open water and encountered a sharp right bend with a few rocks which might challenge
beginners at this flow (1.4?). &nbsp;After that it was mostly staightforwards class 2 then class
1 and then some &#39;forested&#39; sections that collect logs and debris so some maneuvering is
required even towards the very end.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I would definitely run this again with less skilled paddlers, sit on tops, canoes but someone in
the group with some class 2-3 skill should go first in the wooded areas to find the safe
passage.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Lots of big open pools, tall cliffs of pocketed limestone, and huge poplars in the river.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
At 1.4 there was ample current the whole way and during spring it could easily go down to 1.1 if
you don&#39;t mind some rocky shoals. &nbsp;In summer I believe it goes underground.&nbsp;

Forum: BoaterTalk From: bankfull1 Dec. 31, 2012 I posted this on a thread below but it got buried,<br/>
and I thought after geeking out on this for a few years the things I've learned might help some<br/>
other boaters catch the Caney Fork in those times where adequate flows are uncertain. First of all,<br/>
while I didn't check the gauge Saturday, I am almost positive that Caney Fork ran at least 1.4, but<br/>
probably more like 1.5 or a little more. There are many factors in predicting flows on the Caney<br/>
Fork, and I wanted to comment on the different styles of predicting flows I've seen mentioned and<br/>
describe the approach that works best for me. First, it is awesome of cravincreeks to make a<br/>
googledoc and share that info with us, and we should contribute to that effort with visuals any<br/>
time we can.<br/>
https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-V9L-xLQBSdMzkxYWVhNjItNjg3Zi00MjE2LTliM2UtZDFlN2VlOTY3YmRk/edit?pli=1<br/>
I like the curves, and you should pay particular attention to three things: 1) Number of Data<br/>
Points: under the scale of science, these curves are surely in their moment of conception. More<br/>
input data is needed to increase accuracy. 2) R factor: look at the curve and you will see r<br/>
factor. The closer that number is to 1, the better the apparent correlation and the more useful it<br/>
could be to paddlers. The correlation to the Calfkiller is only a 0.6, and Daddys has an r factor<br/>
of 0.62. However the new Obed gauge at Adams Bridge has an r factor of 0.95! This is because both<br/>
the Caney Fork and the Obed start right next to each other in Crossville. 3) Using only one of<br/>
these, even the Obed with a 0.95 r factor is choosing to ignore other data. Use all three in suite<br/>
with rainfall totals/distribution to get the whole picture. Second, while DeRossett is a great rain<br/>
gauge to use, it is not always the best indicator. It definitely wasn't in this situation. The rain<br/>
gauge at DeRossett is west of the Caney Fork watershed. Most of the rain fell in the southern and<br/>
eastern portions of the watershed, as indicated by the rain gauge in Crossville and the rainfall<br/>
graphics on the NOAA site in the Meadow Lake Park area. So if you always just assume DeRossett is<br/>
the best indicator, you will short yourself on windows to boat the Caney Fork. Here is how I look<br/>
at predicting flows on Caney Fork, and this is the same methodology I apply anywhere else: 1) rain<br/>
gauges / graphics: First of all, the new estimated rainfall graphics available here<br/>
http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ridge2/RFC_Precip/ are a game changer in predicting flows. While they are<br/>
theoretical estimates, I can safely say the error bars seem to be smaller than worth bringing up.<br/>
They are verified and weight adjusted based on actual rain gauges in the area, and this particular<br/>
link weaves multiple radar source data sets together. This stuff is high tech and has changed<br/>
everything for many boaters. Just bring the transparency down to the 30% range and zoom in to see<br/>
which watershed got how much rain. You will be able to see what parts of the watershed got rain,<br/>
and how uniform or not the rainfall was. This degree of resolution is necessary when you only have<br/>
a limited window to boat. With the long nights of winter coinciding with the plateau paddling<br/>
season, timing is everything and these graphics help you boat proactively instead of<br/>
re-actively(you can hit the road based on where the rain fell instead of waiting on slow to respond<br/>
river gauges). NOAA,AFWS, and a few other organizations put actual rain gauge info online. Most<br/>
gauges on the plateau are NOAA gauges and can be found here:<br/>
http://amazon.nws.noaa.gov/hads/charts/TN.html There are 3 rain gauges I use to estimate rainfall<br/>
in the Caney Fork: a) DeRossett - just West of the watershed b) Crossville RAWS - just East of the<br/>
watershed c) Big Lick - SE of the watershed These three surround the Caney Fork, and give a fair<br/>
picture of how uniform the distribution of rainfall was. Caney Fork can run when 1 or 2 of these<br/>
gauges have little to no rain if the rain is localized enough. Very rarely are totals uniform<br/>
across the whole watershed. Sure it doesn't matter when everything blew up the day before and you<br/>
know it's gonna be running, but we know that. The difficulty lies in deciding whether to take a<br/>
chance when it is questionable whether there has been enough rain to get it high enough to paddle.<br/>
To just put all your cards in with one of these gauges every rain event is just going to increase<br/>
the potential for missing windows of opportunity. Assuming good baseflows, 0.5 to 1.0 inches of<br/>
rain should be enough. However if the Caney Fork just dropped out the day before, like in this<br/>
case, as little as 0.20 inches of well distributed rain will do the trick. 2) Stream gauges: Here<br/>
are the useful gauges in estimating flow in the Caney Fork: a) USGS Calfkiller (175 square mile<br/>
drainage)- most popular correlation, but least connectivity to the Caney Fork watershed. This gauge<br/>
is a decent correlation, but is most useful in determining whether the water table and karst of the<br/>
western plateau is charged and full or not. The Calfkiller dabbles in the same geologic conditions<br/>
as most of the gorge of the Caney Fork, whereas the Obed and Daddys encounter little to no karst.<br/>
The Caney Fork ups the ante on most other streams with the added complexity of this karst<br/>
topography (limestone, ie caves). If the water table is not charged, 2-3 times the amount of rain<br/>
that would normally get the Caney Fork going still might not be enough. Looking at historical<br/>
annual graphs, it is easy to see when the fill is met and surface base flows develop. On the<br/>
Calfkiller, you want to see over 1000 cfs for the Caney Fork to be running 1.4 or higher. The<br/>
response time of water draining the plateau and then meandering through the valley to Sparta where<br/>
this gauges is can be significant. A substantial portion of the watershed exists in the valley and<br/>
can reduce this gauges usefulness in predictions. Knowing where the rain fell and what is causing<br/>
the gauge to rise is important; see above on rain gauges and graphics. If this gauge has already<br/>
peaked, you can be sure the Caney Fork did as much as a day earlier, assuming no new rain. b) USGS<br/>
Daddys Creek (139 square mile drainage) - The daddys drainage meets the southeast side of the Caney<br/>
Fork drainage, and is useful in knowing what baseflows are doing on the top of the plateau. The<br/>
gauge is a ways further downstream in it's watershed than the put-in for the Caney Fork though, so<br/>
it often starts to rise after the Caney Fork (111 square miles at its put-in). This makes Daddys<br/>
more useful in estimating baseflow conditions for the Caney Fork than response flows to recent<br/>
rains. That considered, if Daddys is over 500 cfs, that is a good indicator there is adequate flow<br/>
in the Caney Fork. c) USGS Obed at Adams Bridge (90 square mile drainage) - this relatively new<br/>
gauge does wonders for knowing what is going on in the Upper Obed, but it does even more for<br/>
paddlers by helping tremendously in predicting flows in the Caney Fork. This gauge usually responds<br/>
to rain a little bit earlier than the Caney Fork put-in, so it is particularly useful in knowing<br/>
what is going on at the Caney Fork. In my experience, over 300 cfs on the Obed is a green light for<br/>
the Caney Fork. d) USGS Basses Creek at Lake Tansi (8 square mile drainage) - this gauge has a<br/>
narrow use, but is great at what it does. This gauge tells you in no uncertain terms if and when<br/>
feeder streams of the Caney Fork are responding to recent rain. This gauge will respond a bit<br/>
earlier than all the others listed since it is so small. Though its smallness makes it useful in<br/>
early indications, this same trait limits it's applicability; it is so small it doesn't tell you if<br/>
what happens there will happen elsewhere in the watershed. This is why you need to use rain<br/>
gauges/graphics as well as stream gauges to get the whole picture. Assuming the rainfall at Lake<br/>
Tansi is indicative of elsewhere in the watershed, all feeders of similar size will rise at similar<br/>
times to Basses, and then begin to move down the main stem to the Caney Fork put-in. Notice that in<br/>
listing these 4 stream gauges I started with the biggest first and then whittle down to the<br/>
smallest last. This is to bring to light the critical component of timing. After a blanket inch of<br/>
rain in the winter, Basses Creek will respond before any of the other gauges. The bubble of several<br/>
streams like Basses comes together and forms a stream like the Obed at Adams. Then the Obed at<br/>
Adams grows and cuts further into the terrain and eventually is the size of Daddys where its gauge<br/>
is. Finally, Daddys eventually builds enough watershed to be the size of the Calfkiller. Since the<br/>
water has to flow from small to big, the timing is offset accordingly. Basses responds first, then<br/>
Obed at Adams, then USGS Daddys, then Calfkiller. Lowland streams at the Calfkiller can cause it to<br/>
respond earlier than it's watershed would suggest though, so this should be taken into account. Not<br/>
only can you not just use one stream gauge, or one rain gauge, but you also can't use only one type<br/>
of data. You have to use rain and stream flow together to answer the important questions. Here's a<br/>
quick rundown of how I used all this to know that Bee Creek and Caney Fork would come up Saturday<br/>
morning: 1) I watched the NOAA rain graphics. While the whole western side of the watershed got<br/>
little to no rain, the area just southwest of crossville got over half an inch, and the graphics<br/>
showed a quarter inch or more from Meadow Lake Park south in the central to southern part of the<br/>
watershed. 2) Now that I knew where the rain likely fell, I moved on to looking at rain gauges for<br/>
verification. The DeRossett gauge showed next to nothing considering where the rain fell, but the<br/>
Crossville gauge showed a third of an inch with slightly less at Big Lick. 3) Next I waited for<br/>
Basses Creek to respond, since I knew it rained there. Basses soon started responding, so next I<br/>
watched for the Obed to start coming back up. Once this happened I felt pretty good about heading<br/>
over there. I knew where the rain fell, and that the little tribs were responding and the main<br/>
steam was starting to as well. 4) I woke up early and hit the road. Since the rain fell less in the<br/>
NW and more in the SE, and also since I like Bee Creek so much, I went to Bee instead of Caney<br/>
Fork. Bee had plenty of water to our delight. When we paddled up to the confluence with the Caney<br/>
Fork, there seemed to be more water coming from it than Bee, which is normal and indicates Caney<br/>
Fork responded to the rain as well . When I got home I noticed that Daddys finally had responded to<br/>
a lesser degree. I also checked the Calfkiller and saw that it barely digressed from it's slow drop<br/>
from the last rain. This squares with what I already knew about the lack of rain in the NW corner<br/>
of the watershed. Basses and the Obed essentially show how the little rain we got turned back the<br/>
hands of time a full day on the Caney Fork/Bee Creek system dropping out. So we caught a good run<br/>
in the watershed with the same levels from the day before. We didn't see anyone else out there. We<br/>
caught it by using all the tools available. And at the end of the day, our predictions and what<br/>
happened balanced. My friend even went back and ran Bee again today and it still had water. The<br/>
point is that there are way more factors in predicting flows than we'll every be able to<br/>
practically address. This post only addresses a few major ones. Other considerations like the<br/>
timing of the actual rainfall across a watershed are there for the considering. But we should<br/>
certainly make use of all the information out there. We should find out about it, logically figure<br/>
out what it tells us, and use it when it counts. The weather is so fickle and hard to predict with<br/>
great accuracy, but in these minimal rain situations we're actually trying to extrapolate upon what<br/>
is already a daunting task of predicting weather. We are trying to predict how a product of weather<br/>
will behave and when. It is certainly complicated, but just like weathermen, we have to use all<br/>
available resources and be open to new ones as they come along. Just as weather prediction has<br/>
gotten much more accurate and precise, so can our flow prediction abilities. NOAA and USGS are<br/>
doing all the work for us, all we have to do is pay attention and be thankful we have access to the<br/>
data. I totally geek out on this stuff, but there is a reason. I don't get to paddle like I used to<br/>
when I was just a college kid with an addiction. I have plenty of responsibilities and little time.<br/>
So when I have a 3 or 6 or 9 hour window to run the best possible run going, I use all the tools<br/>
available to hedge my bets towards success. Figuring all this stuff out has taken years of failure,<br/>
thought, and number crunching, but nowadays I put in little effort to figure it out, because I have<br/>
put in the time. You don't have to put in the time like I did, just take what I've figured out and<br/>
roll with it. No point re-inventing the wheel, but there is certainly no use in just riding around<br/>
on a donkey. Surf the net and find the gold on the information superhighway. Kirk CaneyFork.pdf -<br/>
