<h2>River Description</h2>
<p>
Overflow Creek is a beautiful stream in the upper West Fork of the Chattooga watershed,
originating in the Osage Mtn. and Blue Valley Overlook areas seen from Hwy 106 near Highlands,
N.C. It is a fairly difficult Class IV-V(V+) creek with some big drops and beautiful scenery. The
difficulty level increases with higher water, becoming pushy with large holes.<br>
<br>
Overflow is narrow below the putin and there are often many trees and limbs in the river - so be
vigilant after a major rain event for new wood. The first 1.5 miles are low-volume Class II-III
before Clear Creek comes in on the left and adds flow and width. The volume picks up considerably
again at Three Forks (where Holcomb, Big and Overflow Creeks converge and become the West Fork of
the Chattooga) - this is an exceptionally beautiful area. There are many sizeable rapids, such as
Hemlock Falls, First Fall or &quot;Pee Wee&quot;, Roundabout, Blind Falls, Gravity Falls,
Singley&#39;s Falls, Marginal Monster, Pinball and Swiss Cheese. The &quot;Big Three&quot; in
difficulty are considered to be Gravity, Marginal and Pinball - though Singley&#39;s Falls has
the greatest verticality (but not as demanding). Technically, the West Fork of the Chattooga
begins at Three Forks, where Wild and Scenic protection is also extended 1/4 mile in all
directions from the river. The Three-Forks trail begins about halfway up the shuttle road on the
right, marked by a large engraved boulder - this trail will meet the river near Swiss Cheese,
with a spur going off left to Holcomb Cr. It also continues West to Rabun Bald&#39;s summit.<br>
<br>
Take-out and Put-In are easily accessed by Forest Service Rd. 86-B and 86 which is now signed as
&quot;Overflow Creek Road&quot; off of Warwoman Rd which either ends or begins on Hwy 28
depending on where you&#39;re driving from. Warwoman Rd has it&#39;s other end in Clayton GA by
the Burger King. From the take-out bridge, drive up 7.0 miles bearing right twice along the way
to the Put-In - just past a culvert, with a short trail descending after the berm. The gravel
road will cross a sizeable creek about halfway up - this is not Overflow, it is Holcomb Creek -
it&#39;s a popular camping spot, so slow down a bit here. The gauge is located on river right
underneath the take-out bridge on a piling support; a little goat-path leads to it. Be sure to
park at take-out and put-in with enough room for other vehicles to pass. I have never heard of
any break-in problems here, though we once found the burnt-out shell of a stolen truck. The
placid stretch below the takeout bridge occasionally sees trout-fishing activity, though in 14
years of paddling Overflow we have yet to ever encounter anyone fishing above it at boatable
flows.<br>
<br>
Overflow has a rich history in the evolution of steep creeking in the Southeast beginning with
Alan Singley&#39;s solo first descent in 1978, and has been a touchstone of many a southern
creekboater - so much so that Perception named a creekboat after it. Footage appears in many
videos, most famously in Wayne Gentry&#39;s iconic debut effort &nbsp;&quot;Southern Fried
Creeking&quot; and is well documented in video clips - some of which are included or referenced
below. Use the Burrell&#39;s Ford level guide (subtract 1.0 ft from this reading to approximate
Overflow&#39;s level) and the AFWS rain gauge for Highlands to determine if it&#39;s running -
which can be an art as much as a science sometimes. Overflow runs off faster than in the past,
due to clearcutting in the watershed according to Clemson forestry students. Several Overflow
veterans believe the gauge area was scoured by hurricane floods in 2004 and now reads about
0.1-0.2 lower than in the past. The Highlands Biological Station used to be a reliable source of
up-to-the-hour rain gauging, but they no longer give this info by phone.

<p>Most folks put in below, as shown. It's often run though, and&nbsp;best at higher water&nbsp;- run right of center to exit the bottom slot on right. Exposed ledge in landing zone below 1.3 ft becomes a serious piton hazard. Too far right and a recirculating cave will work you.&nbsp; Keep your bow up.</p><br>

<p>Double drop of maybe 12 and&nbsp;9 ft. Eddy above, run center/right center. There's a submerged piton rock center/left at lower water - be careful.

About an 18 ft drop, not an easy scout but can be had on right; more fun to just run it. Stay away from the left side - bad recirculating hole with cave. Launch center or right of center after picking your way down about 40 yds of Class III approach to horizon line - stay right of the little rooster tail on horizon line.

Blind drop, eddy right to scout. Two drops of maybe 9 and 12 ft. Can be run center or boofing into left channel and staying left. Pothole on right to be avoided. There have occasionally been small trees in the left boof channel - which are hard to see. It's presently clear.<br>

Easy Class 5. Sloping 60 deg drop of maybe 30 ft. Approach far left or center. Manky at lower levels, go for big air down the ski mogul rocks on left. Cave on right if you get your bow pointed that way. A well-known hairboater had to return 3 days later to retrieve his boat from under here. Traditional fun to take first-timers down without scouting, then watch their faces from the bottom eddy. Here's a link to some great footage by Shane Benedict of Singley's as well as other rapids:

Run right over the flake rock, through the slot on right. Two more drops in here spaced about 15 yds apart, ending in the 4th, "Twilight." The whole series rates a solid Class IV, which becomes Class 5 at 2.0 ft. (Does Robert ever actually use his paddle?)<br>

<p>4th drop beginning with Singley's Slot, river narrows considerably here -boof over the pyramid rock in center but not right of it - there's a cave back there, thumping cave at high water. Rock may be dry at 1.0 ft or below so boof it a little left. Watch for tree overhead in the exit after landing. At 2.0 ft and above Singley's Slot through Twilight becomes Class 5 as all four drops run together into one large rapid. Here's a shot of the boof off the pyramid rock with drops 2 and 3 of the rapid in the background.</p><br>

Not much of a rapid really, but a very scenic spot: Big Creek is pouring in from left over a large drop and around the boulders right is Holcomb Creek. Savor the scene just before entering Igor. This is a hike-out spot along Holcomb to the 3-Forks trail to FS 86-B if ever needed - like if Overflow flashes up to 4.5 ft, which has happened. The trail continues on the river left side past Big Creek up the ridge to a dead-ended gravel road "Three Forks Road" coming off Hwy 28.<br>

The Big Kahuna. Bad keeper hole on top left of first drop, one near-drowning reported. Catch the eddy at top after a hairy ferry.

Long, complex rapid with many routes, some of which you may not have intended to run. Very busy rapid, and not a place to flip - head and rib injuries have occured here. Classic line is down the center below the top boulder, or right. A few runs left have been made. Hole at bottom left will flip but not keep you. There's a good video attached. Easy portage left if desired.<br>

We ran yesterday. Put on at 1.8 and took off at 2.1. The correlation with burrell's ford is not<br/>
exact. According to that guage overflow should have peaked around 1.6 (but we physically saw it at<br/>
2.1). I suppose it's okay for a general idea of what is going on at overflow but not totally<br/>
accurate. Also, I have heard a lot of people from different groups say that the bridge guage is<br/>
reading lower than it used to.... like 1ft now is closer to what 1.2 used to be. I can't confirm<br/>
this but have heard it from several different people. Dallas </div>

Word is that the Forest Service is requiring that permits be filled out prior to a run, as with the<br/>
Chattooga. The form is the same - I don't know if forms are being made available at the takeout or<br/>
if you have to go to the kiosk at the Hwy 76 parking lot for Chattooga (which would be a major<br/>
inconvenience). Indicate the level on the form. </div>

The Chattooga River is the WRONG gage to use as an indicater for Overflow Creek. A much more<br/>
accurate gage is the USGS Cullasaja River at SR 1620. Here's how the levels correlate so far:<br/>
<br/>
When Cullasaja is 225 cfs Overflow is around Low (about 0.9)<br/>
When Cullasaja is 310 cfs Overflow is around medium (about 1.5)<br/>
When Cullasaja is 500 cfs Overflow is high. (about 2.0)<br/>
<br/>
I have an Excel 2000 spreadsheet that predicts the levels for Overflow Creek and several other<br/>
rivers in the southeast. If you'd like a copy of this spreadsheet e-mail me at<br/>
H2Olevelcheck@boatingbeta.com and I will send it to you. I only check this address weekly, so<br/>
pardon me if I don't get back to you right away.<br/>

Just thought I would expand on the directions to the river for all of those interested. Please feel<br/>
free to correct my mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
From SC take Hwy 28 North. Turn Left onto Warwoman Rd. Then turn Right onto Overflow Creek Rd. The<br/>
first bridge you come to will cross over Overflow Creek. This is where the guage is for Overflow<br/>
and is the take out for the creek. To get to the put in continue on Overflow Creek Rd and turn<br/>
Right onto 83-B. Follow 83-B (keeping to your right at every junction) until it dead ends. You will<br/>
see the culvert that the water comes through. The put in is just below the first waterfall that you<br/>
see from the parking area. (At least it was for me that day!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who cleared the road last weekend which made my trip possible. It was my first time<br/>
down the river and wouldn't have been possible w/o your help! </div>

&gt;Oops, sorry Craig. You asked for specific information, not a history lesson.<br/>
But it's the best that I could do. I haven't been back!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, you haven't been back, because you found Overflow! ( pppttttuppp! )<br/>
<br/>
Your history is actually pretty good, for such an old geezer as yourself. Have<br/>
you been taking some vitamins or sumthin?<br/>
<br/>
I'll try to remember my version - to be possibly corrected by the actual<br/>
victims.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after you ran Big Creek, Ken, Alan Singley entered West Fork<br/>
history. He had hiked Overflow, Holcomb, and Big Creeks a good deal by then<br/>
- as well as the north fork Chatooga Sections 1, Zero, Double Zero, and<br/>
Minus 1, and even Scotsman's Branch. One fine day, I believe in 1975, or maybe<br/>
1976, he dropped his boating and camping gear off at the culvert bridge, now<br/>
famous as the Overflow put-in, drove his truck to the West Fork bridge, and<br/>
hiked back up to spend the night. The next afternoon, about 5 miles and 8 or<br/>
9 portages later, Alan emerged with wondrous tales of a fantastic whitewater<br/>
run, with the improbable name of Overflow Creek. The fact that he *soloed*<br/>
the exploratory doesn't surprise anyone who knows Alan.<br/>
<br/>
Alan's spectacular, if somewhat unbelievable, tales fascinated everyone, but<br/>
failed to gain him a partner for another descent. Undaunted, Alan proceeded<br/>
on another *solo* run, this time with 5 or 6 portages. Finally he convinced<br/>
another boater to accompany him, none other than Robert Harrison, an open<br/>
boater of some renown. Alan and Robert survived, but, alas, Robert's Old Town<br/>
Tripper was finished, thanks to Pinball. If I recall, Robert made about 7<br/>
portages on that trip. Should have been eight. Robert's account of that<br/>
descent convinced everyone that Alan Singley was not only crazy, but a menace<br/>
to society in general, and to paddlers in particular. It was truly amazing to<br/>
watch Robert's face as he told us of - the Terror That Was Overflow. This<br/>
sufficiently warned everyone, so again Alan could find nobody to paddle<br/>
Overflow with him. So, typically, he made the 4th descent solo, this time<br/>
with 4 portages. This was sometime in 1977.<br/>
<br/>
That year Diane and I moved to Highlands, NC, situated on top of the ridge that<br/>
separates Overflow Creek from the Cullasaja River. I was glad to get<br/>
re-acquainted with Alan, who previously had introduced me to the Watauga. One<br/>
fall afternoon, Alan and I were settin' around jus' doin' nuthin' (that's how<br/>
it is said up there), and he casually mentioned that I ought to 'take a look<br/>
at' Overflow. Before I knew it, we were crashing through the rhododendrons<br/>
with our boats, just downstream of the culvert. We put in on this beautiful<br/>
little gurgling creek, in incredibly beautiful surrounding, and then Alan took<br/>
off, with me in tow. I can't tell you how many times I followed this young<br/>
giant, sitting up high in his C-1, down some unforgettable adventure into the<br/>
unknown, but this was to be the most memorable of them all!<br/>
<br/>
About a mile later, my head was spinning after running some of the most<br/>
incredible rapids I had ever done. We pulled into an eddy, for the first time<br/>
since the put-in, and Alan said &quot;what do you think?&quot; I was nearly speechless,<br/>
but his next sentence struck me dumb! &quot;We're starting to get close to the big<br/>
drops, so stay close.&quot; &quot;Big drops?&quot; I stammered, &quot;What have we been running<br/>
for the last mile?&quot; He said nothing, but smiled and peeled out. I got really<br/>
nervous when he eddied out in a few yards, and said &quot;this is a pretty good one<br/>
- just stay right and you'll be fine&quot;. Then he took off, and disappeared<br/>
over the edge. I thought I'd seen him for the last time. I scrambled out<br/>
onto a rock and looked at the horizon line, expecting traces of wreckage, and<br/>
finally saw the tip of his paddle waving. Not wanting to be left, I swallowed<br/>
hard and . . .<br/>
<br/>
It was unreal! I asked Alan how many times he had run that 15 foot falls, and<br/>
when he said &quot;Once - today&quot;, I knew the name of that drop immediately - Blind<br/>
Falls.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the run was like a dream - a whitewater dream. Singley's Falls<br/>
waited for another day, and we stayed permanently away from Gravity and the<br/>
Great Marginal Monster.<br/>
<br/>
Then you entered the picture, Ken, and now the whole world knows! Well, maybe<br/>
its not just your fault. Anyway, Overflow is too special not to share.<br/>
<br/>
So that's what I know of the history. Or maybe I just imagined it. Either<br/>
way, it's really quite, uhh, well . . ( pppttttuppp! )<br/>
<br/>
Ken, was the first run we did together on Overflow before or after that<br/>
ill-fated Section Zero run? (Is the statue of limitations up yet?)<br/>

It was the summer of 1978 and the Chatooga had just got the big rain. Several<br/>
of us working for NOC and Southeastern had all our trips cancelled, even<br/>
Section 3 was too high for a trip that day. We had all heard about Overflow<br/>
from the locals, knew there were a few drops still unrun and decided we'd give<br/>
it a shot. I'm bad with names and don't remember all the SE boaters but this<br/>
was probably the biggest group to hit Overflow up to this point. Some of the<br/>
folks with us were John Kennedy in a Mark V, John Regan in a Sauna, Les<br/>
Bechtel in a 14' Phoenix baot ??, myself in a Slipper, Chis Spelius in an<br/>
NOC saftey boat - a Hallowform, Bill Baxter and Gary Duven both in NOC safety<br/>
boats also and I have pretty much forgot all the others but believe Jim<br/>
Schelander was also along for the ride and we must not forget Rex Shawberg who<br/>
gave us all the scare of our lives at Marginal Monster.<br/>
<br/>
I believe this was the first trip that all the drops were run on Overflow and<br/>
the West Fork. We had some great lines and some not so great lines but had<br/>
a great group and some great fun. I actually have some great slides and<br/>
pictures I haven't looked at in years. My favorite is the one of Les running<br/>
Blind Falls in that 14'+ boat. This guy was unbelieveable and now the owner<br/>
of Canyons Inc out in Idaho if you ever want a great trip down the Middle<br/>
Fork of the Salmon.<br/>
<br/>
By the time we got to the take out all the Hollowforms had about 6&quot; to 1' of<br/>
the nose pointed towards Heaven. John Kennedy went through the hole at<br/>
the bottom of Marginal and we watched as his stern seams blew out on both<br/>
sides. The nose of my Slipper and John Regan's Sauna also would require some<br/>
minimal repairs also.<br/>
<br/>
Rex Shauberg had the crash of the day at Marginal. He ran the first drop and<br/>
got a little back ender that took him away from the left side of the next drop<br/>
and sent him towards the right and the undercut, which at that time had some<br/>
tree debris in it. I've got some pictures of Rex while this was happening but<br/>
there wasn't much any of us could do to help him until he got away from the<br/>
undercut. He, of course, was fine but gave us a good scare.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just curious if any of these earlier posters to this thread were on this<br/>
trip with us? Sorry, but I was never great with names when I don't spend a lot<br/>
of time with someone. This trip is one of several of my fondest memories of<br/>
paddling and Overflow/West Fork will always be a Southern Classic run to me.<br/>
<br/>
The next day it was section 4 at 5'+. A really great break from raft guiding<br/>
in the summer of 1978. May get some of those pics to a scanner and post a URL<br/>
for anyone who'd like to see some of the pics at a later time. -Bo </div>
